  abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), and particularly in deep learning (DL), have created tremendous excitement and opportunities in the earth and environmental sciences communities. To leverage these new ‘data-driven’ technologies, however, one needs to understand the fundamental concepts that give rise to DL and how they differ from ‘process-based’, mechanistic modelling. This paper revisits those fundamentals and addresses 10 questions that might be posed by earth and environmental scientists, and with the aid of a real-world modelling experiment, it explains some critical, but often ignored, issues DL may face in practice. The overarching objective is to contribute to a future of AI-assisted earth and environmental sciences where AI models can (1) embrace the typically ignored knowledge base available, (2) function credibly in ‘true’ out-of-sample prediction, and (3) handle non-stationarity in earth and environmental systems. Comparing and contrasting earth and environmental problems with prominent AI applications, such as playing chess and trading in stock markets, provides critical insights for better directing future research in this field.},

@article{hamed_modified_1998,
	abstract = {One of the commonly used tools for detecting changes in climatic and hydrologic time series is trend analysis. A number of statistical tests exist to assess the significance of trends in time series. One of the commonly used non-parametric trend tests is the Mann-Kendall trend test. The null hypothesis in the Mann-Kendall test is that the data are independent and randomly ordered. However, the existence of positive autocorrelation in the data increases the probability of detecting trends when actually none exist, and vice versa. Although this is a well-known fact, few studies have addressed this issue, and autocorrelation in the data is often ignored. In this study, the effect of autocorrelation on the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test statistic is discussed. A theoretical relationship is derived to calculate the variance of the Mann-Kendall test statistic for autocorrelated data. The special cases of {AR}(1) and {MA}(1) dependence are discussed as examples. An approximation to the theoretical relationship is also presented in order to reduce computation time for long time series. Based on the modified value of the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test statistic, a modified non-parametric trend test which is suitable for autocorrelated data is proposed. The accuracy of the modified test in terms of its empirical significance level was found to be superior to that of the original Mann-Kendall trend test without any loss of power. The modified test is applied to rainfall as well as streamflow data to demonstrate its performance as compared to the original Mann-Kendall trend test.},

In this paper, 12 spheres of discharge of springs are defined, sketched, displayed with photographs, and described relative to their hydrogeology of occurrence, and the microhabitats and ecosystems they support. A few of the spheres of discharge have been previously recognized and used by hydrogeologists for over 80 years, but others have only recently been defined geomorphologically. A comparison of these spheres of discharge to classification systems for wetlands, groundwater dependent ecosystems, karst hydrogeology, running waters, and other systems is provided. With a common lexicon for springs, hydrogeologists can provide more consistent guidance for springs ecosystem conservation, management, and restoration. As additional comprehensive inventories of the physical, biological, and cultural characteristics are conducted and analyzed, it will eventually be possible to associate spheres of discharge with discrete vegetation and aquatic invertebrate assemblages, and better understand the habitat requirements of rare or unique springs species. Given the elevated productivity and biodiversity of springs, and their highly threatened status, identification of geomorphic similarities among spring types is essential for conservation of these important ecosystems. © Springer-Verlag 2008.},

The purpose of this study was to develop a methodology to evaluate the potential for riparian vegetation restoration and groundwater recharge. A numerical groundwater flow model was coupled with a conceptual riparian vegetation model to predict hydrologic conditions favorable to maintaining riparian vegetation downstream of a reservoir. A Geographic Information System ({GIS}) was used for this one-way coupling. Constant and seasonally varying releases from the dam were simulated using volumes anticipated to be permitted by a regional water supplier. Simulations indicated that seasonally variable releases would produce surface flow 5.4-8.5 km below the dam in a previously dry reach. Using depth to groundwater simulations from the numerical flow model with conceptual models of depths to water necessary for maintenance of riparian vegetation, the {GIS} analysis predicted a 5- to 6.5-fold increase in the area capable of sustaining riparian vegetation.},

	abstract = {Small, low order channels located in wet meadows along the Mogollon Rim of northern Arizona that receive the bulk of their flow from spring discharge exhibit a morphology that differs markedly from channels that receive the bulk of their flow from runoff. These small, spring-dominated channels generally have dense vegetation cover, vertical (or near vertical) banks with flat channel beds that are armored with clasts up to 60 mm. Clasts armoring the spring-dominated channels become mobile at 45 to 85\% of the bankfull depth. The lack of fine-grained material in the bed of the spring-dominated channels reflects the small drainage size, lack of fine grain input from the spring, and winnowing affect of the consistent discharge. Minor amounts of large woody debris were present in some of the spring-dominated channels, however, unlike previous studies it does not appear to play a role in the spring-dominated channel morphology. Sinuosity values for spring-dominated channels averaged 1.19, while the average sinuosity values for the runoff-dominated channels, 1.08, were significantly lower. Measured width-to-depth ratios averaged 2.4 in the spring-dominated channels, much lower than the average ratio of 11.6 found for the runoff-dominated channels. The standard deviation of width-to-depth ratios was higher for runoff-dominated channels, reflecting a more variable channel profile. A third channel type, here referred to as hybrid channels, receive significant flow from both springs and runoff. These channels have characteristics that fall between spring-dominated and runoff-dominated channels. Elevation, gradient, organic matter content, and sediment grain size distribution of the wet meadows in which the channels are formed do not exhibit significant differences between channel types, suggesting that these factors are not responsible for the observed differences in channel morphologies. The major differences in controls on the channel morphology found between the spring-dominated and runoff-dominated channels are the discharge regime and the sediment input. The hydrology unique to the spring-dominated channels and the lack of fine-grained sediment input combine to create the observed differences. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Understanding the sources and processes that control groundwater compositions and the timing and magnitude of groundwater vulnerability to potential surface-water contamination under varying meteorologic conditions is critical to informing groundwater protection policies and practices. This is especially true in karst terrains, where infiltrating surface water can rapidly affect groundwater quality. We analyzed the evolution of groundwater compositions (major ions and Sr isotopes) during the transition from extreme drought to wet conditions, and used inverse geochemical modeling ({PHREEQC}) to constrain controls on groundwater compositions during this evolution. Spring water and groundwater from two wells dominantly receiving diffuse and conduit flow (termed diffuse site and conduit site, respectively) in the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards aquifer (central Texas, {USA}) and surface water from losing streams that recharge the aquifer were sampled every 3-4. weeks during November 2008-March 2010. During this period, water compositions at the spring and conduit sites changed rapidly but there was no change at the diffuse site, illustrating the dual nature (i.e., diffuse vs. conduit) of flow in this karst system. Geochemical modeling demonstrated that, within a month of the onset of wet conditions, the majority of spring water and groundwater at the conduit site was composed of surface water, providing quantitative information on the timing and magnitude of the vulnerability of groundwater to potential surface-water contamination. The temporal pattern of increasing spring discharge and changing pattern of covariation between spring discharge and surface-water (steam) recharge indicates that that there were two modes of aquifer response-one with a small amount of storage and a second that accommodates more storage. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In the arid landscape south of the Grand Canyon, natural springs and seeps are a critical resource for endemic species and Native American tribes. Groundwater is potentially threatened by expanding populations, tourism, and mineral extraction activities. Environmental tracers, including noble gases, stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in water, tritium, and carbon-14, were used to characterize recharge sources and flow paths in South Rim aquifers. Results confirm the regional Redwall-Muav aquifer is the primary groundwater source to springs. However, a second local recharge source is required to explain the detection of tritium. Probable sources are: (1) low-elevation infiltration of surface run-off with warm recharge temperatures and high excess air determined from noble gas models, and relatively low fractions of winter recharge, and (2) high-elevation plateau recharge with cool recharge temperatures, low excess air, and fraction of winter recharge of approximately 1. Previous investigators have linked spring occurrence with regional faults and fractures. Such features also likely control the chemical mixing between the regional and local groundwater sources, the transport of deeply sourced and local recharge fluids, groundwater age, and thus the relative vulnerability of groundwater to depletion and contamination. The new conceptual model of groundwater sources and flow paths suggests that many South Rim springs may respond on the order of tens to hundreds of years to groundwater depletion and contamination, even though the majority of groundwater flow is along longer flow paths with longer lag times. The magnitude of response to short-term changes in the flow system remains unclear.},

	abstract = {Snow provides a key water source for stream flow and agricultural production across western North America and drinking water for large populations in the Southwest. Accurate estimates of snow cover spatial distribution and temporal dynamics are important at regional and local scales as snow cover is projected to decrease due to global climate change. We examined regional-scale temporal trends in snow distribution across central and northern Arizona using two tiles of 2928 daily images of {MOD}10 snow product. The analysis included the entire {MODIS} archive time period, October 1, 2003-June 1, 2014, and a 245,041km2 area of 51 {HUC}8 watersheds. We also examined the effects of a regional forest restoration effort, known as the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), aimed at enhancing snow accumulation and retention for increased groundwater recharge through forest thinning and burning treatments. We analyzed 66 Landsat {TM}/{ETM}+ images spanning 26years between 1988 and 2014 at five sites and one hyperspectral image from 2014 at two sites. The {MOD}10 snow product performs well in estimating Arizona's thin and discontinuous snow distribution. Mann-Kendall time-series analysis indicate significantly increasing trends in the annual number of snow cover days ({SCD}) over the 12-year period in 1.6\% of the region at elevation transitions such as the Mogollon Rim in central Arizona, while significantly decreasing trends are observed at a few locations of lower elevations leading to the desert margins in eastern Arizona. The observed temporal trends are mostly consistent with ground-based {SNOTEL} snow measurements. An Arizona specific, Landsat sensor-derived binary classification model, similar to the {MOD}10 product, was developed at a local scale. It performs better than commonly-used simple threshold-based approaches, but demonstrates the continued challenges associated with Landsat sensor-derived snow classification in Arizona likely due to its coarse temporal resolution. Landsat-derived multi-temporal Normalized Difference Snow Index ({NDSI}) analysis indicate that treated (thinned and thinned-and-burned) forest sites had significantly greater {NDSI} values than untreated control sites. Snowpack at treated sites also appeared to persist longer into the spring season with potentially greater contributions to groundwater recharge in this semi-arid region. The high-resolution hyperspectral data analysis indicate that sites treated to approximately 24\% forest canopy cover appear to have an optimum threshold for accumulating and maintaining snowpack. It balances canopy cover versus canopy gap, which reduces snow interception and sublimation by canopy, while providing enough shade. These results are encouraging for the 4FRI, the first and largest forest restoration effort in the {US} history, aimed at improving watershed health and function in the face of changing climate.},

	url = {http://www.raws.dri.edu.},
	abstract = {Climate change and wildfire are interacting to drive vegetation change and potentially reduce water quantity and quality in the southwestern United States, Forest restoration is a management approach that could mitigate some of these negative outcomes. However, little information exists on how restoration combined with climate change might influence hydrology across large forest landscapes that incorporate multiple vegetation types and complex fire regimes. We combined spatially explicit vegetation and fire modeling with statistical water and sediment yield models for a large forested landscape (335,000 ha) on the Kaibab Plateau in northern Arizona, {USA}. Our objective was to assess the impacts of climate change and forest restoration on the future fire regime, forest vegetation , and watershed outputs. Our model results predict that the combination of climate change and high-severity fire will drive forest turnover, biomass declines, and compositional change in future forests. Restoration treatments may reduce the area burned in high-severity fires and reduce conversions from forested to non-forested conditions. Even though mid-elevation forests are the targets of restoration , the treatments are expected to delay the decline of high-elevation spruce-fir, aspen, and mixed conifer forests by reducing the occurrence of high-severity fires that may spread across ecoregions. We estimate that climate-induced vegetation changes will result in annual runoff declines of up to 10\%, while restoration reduced or reversed this decline. The hydrologic model suggests that mid-elevation forests, which are the targets of restoration treatments, provide around 80\% of runoff in this system and the conservation of mid-to high-elevation forests types provides the greatest benefit in terms of water conservation. We also predict that restoration treatments will conserve water quality by reducing patches of high-severity fire that are associated with high sediment yield. Restoration treatments are a management strategy that may reduce undesirable outcomes for multiple ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Forest thinning has been used as a management tool to reverse the adverse impacts of decades of fire suppression in the western {USA}. Research into the impacts of thinning on surface water, soil, and vegetation re-growth have occurred concurrently with the growing popularity of forest thinning, however, the impact on groundwater recharge and related springs ecosystems has largely been ignored until recently. This paper provides an overview of some of the tools used to measure the influence of forest management on groundwater recharge including numerical and process based modeling, empirical paired-watershed approaches, and statistical stochastic techniques. A brief discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of each method also is provided. We present examples from a large forest restoration initiative (4FRI) to provide context for other forest restoration treatments in arid and semi-arid environments. The paper also provides a literature review of existing studies of groundwater recharge and forest management from 1971 to 2018. The review of 35 studies indicates a range of results with a statistically significant difference between studies of clear-cut forests to thinned forests ({ANOVA}, p = 0.09). Forests that were thinned had a greater amount of groundwater recharge than clear-cut forests, indicating that snow sublimation, evaporation, and vegetative ground cover in clear-cut treatments is more detrimental to recharge than the increased amount of mature trees removed. A similar test with forest encroachment studies displayed no significant difference between forest encroachment and either thinning regimes. The number of forest management-groundwater recharge studies has dramatically increased in the last two decades, potentially demonstrating the increased interest in finding tools to increase groundwater yields for societal use in the rapidly populating southwestern {USA}. To date there have been no known studies of forest thinning impacts on springs ecosystems, a field of study rich with possibilities for ecologists, hydrologists, rangeland and forestry scientists, and interdisciplinary ecohydrology practitioners.},

	abstract = {Thinning of semi-arid forests to reduce wildfire risk is believed to improve forest health by increasing soil moisture. Increased snowpack, reduced transpiration and reduced rainfall interception are frequently cited mechanisms by which reduced canopy density may increase soil moisture. However, the relative importance of these factors has not been rigorously evaluated in field studies. We measured snow depth, snow water equivalent ({SWE}) and the spatial and temporal variation in soil moisture at four experimental paired treatment-control thinning sites in high elevation ponderosa pine forest northern Arizona, {USA}. We compared snow and soil moisture measurements with forest structure metrics derived from aerial imagery and 3-dimensional lidar data to determine the relationship between vegetation structure, snow and soil moisture throughout the annual hydrologic cycle. Soil moisture was consistently and significantly higher in thinned forest plots, even though the treatments were performed 8–11 years before this study. However, we did not find evidence that {SWE} was higher in thinned forests across a range of snow conditions. Regression tree analysis of soil moisture and vegetation structure data provided some evidence that localized differences in transpiration and interception of precipitation influence the spatial pattern of soil moisture at points in the annual hydrologic cycle when the system is becoming increasingly water limited. However, vegetation structure explained a relatively low amount of the spatial variance (R2 {\textless} 0.23) in soil moisture. Continuous measurements of soil moisture in depth profiles showed stronger attenuation of soil moisture peaks in thinned sites, suggesting differences in infiltration dynamics may explain the difference in soil moisture between treatments as opposed to overlying vegetation alone. Our results show limited support for commonly cited relationships between vegetation structure, snow and soil moisture and indicate that future research is needed to understand how reduction in tree density alters soil hydraulic properties.},

	abstract = {Prolonged drought conditions in semi-arid forests can lead to widespread vegetation stress and mortality. However, the distribution of these effects is not spatially uniform. We measured soil water potential at high spatial and temporal resolution using 112 sensors distributed across a ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona, {USA}, during two abnormally dry years with below-average total precipitation. We used the data to assess the effects of fore-summer drought period on the timing, magnitude, and extent of drying throughout the top 100 cm of the soil profile. Additionally, we use high spatial resolution terrestrial lidar measurements of forest structure to develop relationships between soil drying and fine-scale forest structure. We find that increasing drought from 2019 to 2020 caused significantly earlier onset of soil dying at all depths (25, 50 and 100 cm) and more days below a critical drying threshold for ponderosa pine. Additionally, our results show that significantly drier soils are found in areas with higher stand-level basal area, canopy cover and tree density, and shorter trees. Our results from the unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution data suggest that tailored restoration thinning with specific tree density and size parameters can be used to increase and prolong the availability of deep soil water to trees during drought.},

	abstract = {We measure the value placed by the American public on ensuring the continued existence of the traditional Hopi culture and way of life at the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. The Hopi are the oldest living culture in the United States. The continued existence of the Reservation is threatened by depletion of the groundwater resource underlying the reservation. In the future, without a new source of water, the Hopi will run out of water to support the villages and continue their traditional Hopi agricultural practices. Many Hopi will have to move off the Reservation and give up their traditional culture and way of life. The Reservation will no longer serve as a permanent home for the Hopi Tribe. An expensive pipeline would be required to convey a new source of water to the Reservation, for which the Federal government might pay. The question is: would the expenditure by the federal government to convey water that would ensure the continued existence of the traditional Hopi culture at the Hopi Reservation be justified by the existence value of that culture to the American people? This paper describes the results of a study undertaken to measure that existence value. We show that a simple stated preference design, using only a single monetary amount, is sufficient to provide a bound.},

	title = {Delineation of a Karst Watershed on Prince of Wales Island, Southeast Alaska},
	abstract = {Karst systems have developed in the extensive areas of carbonate bedrock underlying portions of the Tongass National Forest, southeast Alaska. Karst development includes losing streams, sinks, caves, grikes, and resurgence streams. Many of the resurgence streams maintain productive salmon populations important to local culture and economics. Identifying source areas of resurgence streams is crucial to protecting water quality and watershed planning in karst ecosystems. Historically, watershed assessments have only considered topographic boundaries when defining various watersheds. This method is difficult in karst areas where surface waters are rare. Two projects on northern Prince of Wales Island, part of the Thorne Bay Ranger District, have employed tracer dye studies to illustrate the complexity of karst systems, and help redefine watershed boundaries to assist in watershed planning efforts. Through dye trace tests we were able to identify subsurface flow pathways, identify downstream effects, and better assess cumulative effects on a watershed scale. Success of groundwater tracing efforts hinged on locating the springs that feed coastal streams. This required careful inventory of shorelines and margins of the carbonate outcrops. Activated charcoal packets were anchored within these streams and springs to absorb dye. Tracer dye injection points were generally discrete karst features where surface waters enter the systems. The charcoal packets were recovered at intervals to allow time for the dye to move through the systems. Tracking the locations of dye injection and recovery helped identify specific subsurface water flow pathways and measure minimum flow velocities. Identification of these subsurface pathways enabled us to delineate karst watershed boundaries, understand the downstream effects of proposed management, and better manage karst areas.},

	abstract = {The Colorado River basin ({CRB}), the primary water source for southwestern North America, is divided into the 283,384 km2, water-exporting Upper {CRB} ({UCRB}) in the Colorado Plateau geologic province, and the 344,440 km2, water-receiving Lower {CRB} ({LCRB}) in the Basin and Range geologic province. Long-regarded as a snowmelt-fed river system, approximately half of the river's baseflow is derived from groundwater, much of it through springs. {CRB} springs are important for biota, culture, and the economy, but are highly threatened by a wide array of anthropogenic factors. We used existing literature, available databases, and field data to synthesize information on the distribution, ecohydrology, biodiversity, status, and potential socio-economic impacts of 20,872 reported {CRB} springs in relation to permanent stream distribution, human population growth, and climate change. {CRB} springs are patchily distributed, with highest density in montane and cliff-dominated landscapes. Mapping data quality is highly variable and many springs remain undocumented. Most {CRB} springs-influenced habitats are small, with a highly variable mean area of 2200 m2, generating an estimated total springs habitat area of 45.4 km2 (0.007\% of the total {CRB} land area). Median discharge also is generally low and variable (0.10 L/s, N = 1687, 95\% {CI} = 0.04 L/s), but ranges up to 1800 L/s. Water {pH} and conductivity is negatively related to elevation, with a stronger negative relationship in the {UCRB} compared to the {LCRB}. Natural springs water temperature and geochemistry throughout the {CRB} varies greatly among springs, but relatively little within springs, and depends on aquifer hydrogeology, elevation, and residence time. As the only state nearly entirely included within the {CRB}, Arizona is about equally divided between the two geologic provinces. Arizona springs produce approximately 0.6 km3/year of water. Data on {\textgreater}330 {CRB} springs-dependent taxa ({SDT}) revealed at least 62 plant species; 216 aquatic and riparian Mollusca, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, and other invertebrate taxa; several herpetofanual species; and two-thirds of 35 {CRB} fish taxa. Springs vegetation structure, composition, and diversity vary strongly by springs type, and plant species density within springs is high in comparison with upland habitats. Plant species richness and density is negatively related to elevation below 2500 m. Human population in and adjacent to the {CRB} are growing rapidly, and ecological impairment of springs exceeds 70\% in many landscapes, particularly in urbanized and rangeland areas. Anthropogenic stressors are primarily related to groundwater depletion and pollution, livestock management, flow abstraction, non-native species introduction, and recreation. Ensuring the ecological integrity and sustainability of {CRB} groundwater supplies and springs will require more thorough basic inventory, assessment, research, information management, and local ecosystem rehabilitation, as well as improved groundwater and springs conservation policy.},

Previously, quantification of baseflow using chemical mass balance at large numbers of sites was not possible because of data limitations. A new method using regression-derived daily specific conductance values with conductivity mass balance hydrograph separation allows for baseflow estimation at sites across large regions. This method was applied to estimate baseflow discharge at 229 sites across the {UCRB}. Subsequently, climate, soil, topography, and land cover characteristics were statistically evaluated using principal component analysis ({PCA}) to determine their influence on baseflow discharge. New hydrological insights for the region: Results suggest that approximately half of the streamflow in the {UCRB} is baseflow derived from groundwater discharge to streams. Higher baseflow yields typically occur in upper elevation areas of the {UCRB}. {PCA} identified precipitation, snow, sand content of soils, elevation, land surface slope, percent grasslands, and percent natural barren lands as being positively correlated with baseflow yield; whereas temperature, potential evapotranspiration, silt and clay content of soils, percent agriculture, and percent shrublands were negatively correlated with baseflow yield.},

	abstract = {Streamwaters and emergent groundwaters in springs and seeps were sampled over the 2003-2004 hydrological year in a geologically complex 31 km2 catchment. Samples were analysed for Gran alkalinity and chloride; tracers that would respectively indicate the provenance and residence times of water. Streamwaters were sampled at the catchment outfall and in nine sub-catchments. Streamwater Gran alkalinity showed predictable fluctuations with flow, with high flows and baseflows exhibiting low and high alkalinity respectively. During storm flow conditions the nine monitoring points exhibited similar levels (0-50 μeq l-1), whilst under baseflows alkalinity was highly variable (300-1000 μeq l-1), depending upon catchment geology. Comprehensive spatial surveys of springs and seeps in 6 of the sub-catchments during a typical summer low flow period revealed marked differences in groundwater chemistry. This broadly related to sub-catchment geology and geochemistry, but local variability implied marked differences in groundwater flow paths, residence times and geochemical reactions. Chloride data indicated a high degree of synchronicity between concentrations in precipitation and streamwaters. In contrast, concentrations in groundwaters were more consistent. This implies that Cl concentrations in the stream depend upon the relative contribution of groundwaters and soil waters where Cl concentrations are respectively more stable and more dynamic. In general, at the catchment scale, mean water residence times appear to be relatively short which appears to relate to the low permeability of soils and bedrock. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The strong correlation between snowmelt rate and baseflow efficiency (r 2 = 0.73) links these relationships and supports a possible streamflow generation mechanism wherein greater snowmelt rates increase subsurface flow. Rapid snowmelt may thus bring the soil to field capacity, facilitating below-root zone percolation, streamflow, and a positive {BSA}. Previous works have shown that future increases in regional air temperature may lead to earlier, slower snowmelt and hence decreased streamflow production via the mechanism proposed by this work.},

The {RKT} is a robust, nonparametric test that provides an increased power of trend detection by grouping data from multiple sites within a given geographic region. The {RKT} analyses indicated strong, pervasive trends in snowmelt and streamflow timing, which have shifted toward earlier in the year by a median of 2-3 weeks over the 29-yr study period. In contrast, relatively few statistically significant trends were detected using simple linear regression. {RKT} analyses also indicated that November-May air temperatures increased by a median of 0.9°C decade-1, while 1 April {SWE} and maximum {SWE} declined by a median of 4.1 and 3.6 cm decade-1, respectively. Multiple linear regression models were created, using monthly air temperatures, snowfall, latitude, and elevation as explanatory variables to identify major controlling factors on snowmelt timing. The models accounted for 45\% of the variance in snowmelt onset, and 78\% of the variance in the snowmelt center of mass (when half the snowpack had melted). Variations in springtime air temperature and {SWE} explained most of the interannual variability in snowmelt timing. Regression coefficients for air temperature were negative, indicating that warm temperatures promote early melt. Regression coefficients for {SWE}, latitude, and elevation were positive, indicating that abundant snowfall tends to delay snowmelt, and snowmelt tends to occur later at northern latitudes and high elevations. Results from this study indicate that even the mountains of Colorado, with their high elevations and cold snowpacks, are experiencing substantial shifts in the timing of snowmelt and snowmelt runoff toward earlier in the year. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Recent observations have documented declining snow water equivalent ({SWE}) and earlier melt in the coastal Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, and climate models suggest that warming temperatures will decrease snowpack storage in the higher-elevation mountain ranges of interior western North America. To date, however, observations of changing {SWE} or snowmelt have been limited to the state of Colorado in the intermountain west ({IMW}), defined here as the Rio Grande, Colorado River, and Great Basins, which supply water to the driest regions of North America. We used daily {SNOTEL} data collected between 1984 and 2009 combined with the nonparametric regional Kendall test to demonstrate significant and widespread changes in the duration of snow cover in these river basins. Daily {SNOTEL} data demonstrated that basin average maximum {SWE} occurred as early as 7 March (Lower Colorado River Basin) and as late as 13 April (Upper Colorado, Yampa, and White River Basins). Although significant increases in winter temperature (T) were widespread, there were minimal changes in the day of maximum accumulation and no indications from {SWE} to winter precipitation ratios ({SWE}:P) and winter T observations that a transition from snow to rain had occurred. While there was little change in day of maximum accumulation, the duration of snow cover decreased in 11 of 13 drainage regions, and snowmelt center of mass ({SM}50) advanced 1 to 4 days per decade in 6 of 13 regions. There were significant trends toward a faster {SM}50 and shorter duration of snow cover in the highest-elevation regions ({\textgreater}2800 m) of the Colorado River Basin, suggesting that winter T and P may not be the primary driver of change. Our results show that the {IMW} hydroclimate is both spatially and temporally variable, with few changes in winter T and P in the Great Basin and drier and warmer winters in the Colorado River and Rio Grande Basins. The changes in snowmelt timing also were variable, with a shorter {SM}50 and less maximum {SWE} in the Colorado River and Rio Grande Basins. The variable response of snowpacks in the {IMW} to widespread warming highlights the need for additional research into the mass and energy balance of these continental snowpacks. © 2012.

	abstract = {The Okanagan Basin, a semi-desert region of western Canada, is currently experiencing rapidly increasing pressure on its water resources from development and population increases, exacerbated by changes in climate. The major source of freshwater in the region originates from the melt of high-elevation snowpacks, about which little is currently known, including the proportion of the peak snowpack lost to sublimation. To better understand the hydrologic regime of this snow resource, a detailed field program was conducted during the 2007 snowmelt season. Specifically, peak annual snow distribution, ablation-season surface-energy exchange and mass balance were measured in a forested high-elevation catchment of the Okanagan Basin. During the snowmelt period, 1-4\% of the peak annual snow-water equivalent ({SWE}) was lost to sublimation in open sites - averaging 0.4 mm d-1. Melt and sublimation rates increased significantly with elevation, and were observed to be higher and more variable in the open sites than under forest canopies. The largest sublimation events ({\textgreater}0.25 mm d-1) were associated with low atmospheric vapour pressure, temperatures below 0°C, and higher than average wind speeds. Condensation occurred under highly stable conditions in the boundary layer when sensible heat fluxes exceeded net radiative inputs to the snow surface. Melt rates were driven almost entirely by sensible heat fluxes and exceeded 30 mm d-1 during large-scale advection events. The results from this study will allow water managers to better predict the amount of water available for ecological, agricultural and municipal needs. This work also provides the basis for assessing changes in snow surface energetics due to ongoing salvage cutting in forested areas affected by the current mountain pine-beetle outbreak.

Measurements in 2008 and 2009 indicate that this net canopy reduction has reduced peak snowpack and melt rate differences between remaining stands (including large clearcuts, younger regenerating stands and dead mature pine stands), relative to a healthy forest canopy with smaller clearcuts. The Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model ({DHSVM}) was calibrated and run at 200 m resolution across the catchment, and simulated snowmelt rates and snow-covered area compared relatively well to distributed satellite or ground-based measurements. Snowpack and ablation rates were 10-20\% higher during the 2008 and 2009 winters than when running the model for the pre-{MPB} landscape in 2000 using the same input meteorological data, resulting in almost no difference in the snowcover period.

	abstract = {Climate change-driven shifts in streamflow timing have been documented for western North America and are expected to continue with increased warming. These changes will likely have the greatest implications on already short and overcommitted water supplies in the region. This study investigated changes in western North American streamflow timing over the 1948-2008 period, including the very recent warm decade not previously considered, through (i) trends in streamflow timing measures, (ii) two second-order linear models applied simultaneously over the region to test for the acceleration of these changes, and (iii) changes in runoff regimes. Basins were categorized by the percentage of snowmelt-derived runoff to enable the comparison of groups of streams with similar runoff characteristics and to quantify shifts in snowmelt-dominated regimes. Results indicate that streamflow has continued to shift to earlier in the water year, most notably for those basins with the largest snowmelt runoff component. However, an acceleration of these streamflow timing changes for the recent warm decades is not clearly indicated. Most coastal rain-dominated and some interior basins have experienced later timing. The timing changes are connected to area-wide warmer temperatures, especially in March and January, and to precipitation shifts that bear subregional signatures. Notably, a set of the most vulnerable basins has experienced runoff regime changes, such that basins that were snowmelt dominated at the beginning of the observational period shifted to mostly rain dominated in later years. These most vulnerable regions for regime shifts are in the California Sierra Nevada, eastern Washington, Idaho, and northeastern New Mexico. Snowmelt regime changes may indicate that the time available for adaptation of water supply systems to climatic changes in vulnerable regions are shorter than previously recognized. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {The water resources of the western United States depend heavily on snowpack to store part of the wintertime precipitation into the drier summer months. A well-documented shift toward earlier runoff in recent decades has been attributed to 1) more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow and 2) earlier snowmelt. The present study addresses the former, documenting a regional trend toward smaller ratios of winter-total snowfall water equivalent ({SFE}) to winter-total precipitation (P) during the period 1949-2004. The trends toward reduce d {SFE} are a response to warming across the region, with the most significant reductions occurring where winter wet-day minimum temperatures, averaged over the study period, were warmer than -5°C. Most {SFE} reductions were associated with winter wet-day temperature increases between 0° and +3°C over the study period. Warmings larger than this occurred mainly at sites where the mean temperatures were cool enough that the precipitation form was less susceptible to warming trends. The trends toward reduced {SFE}/P ratios w ere most pronounced in March regionwide and in January near the West Coast, corresponding, to widespread warming in these months. While mean temperatures in March were sufficiently high to allow the warming, trend to produce {SFE}/P declines across the study region, mean January temperatures were cooler. with the result that January {SFE}/P impacts were restricted to the lower elevations near the West Coast. Extending the analysis back to 1920 sho ws that although the trends presented here may be partially attributable to interdecadal climate variability associated with the Pacific decadal oscillation. they also appear to result from still longer-term climate shifts.},

Downscaled transient temperature and precipitation sequences were extracted from {PCM} simulations, and were used to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity ({VIC}) macroscale hydrology model to produce corresponding streamflow sequences. Results for the {BAU} scenarios were summarized into Periods 1, 2, and 3 (2010-2039, 2040-2069, 2070-2098). Average annual temperature changes for the Colorado River basin were 0.5°C warmer for control climate, and 1.0, 1.7, and 2.4°C warmer for Periods 1-3, respectively, relative to the historical climate. Basin-average annual precipitation for the control climate was slightly (1\%) less than for observed historical climate, and 3, 6, and 3\% less for future Periods 1-3, respectively. Annual runoff in the control run was about 10\% lower than for simulated historical conditions, and 14, 18, and 17\% less for Periods 1-3, respectively. Analysis of water management operations using a water management model driven by simulated streamflows showed that streamflows associated with control and future {BAU} climates would significantly degrade the performance of the water resources system relative to historical conditions, with average total basin storage reduced by 7\% for the control climate and 36, 32 and 40\% for Periods 1-3, respectively. Releases from Glen Canyon Dam to the Lower Basin (mandated by the Colorado River Compact) were met in 80\% of years for the control climate simulation (versus 92\% in the historical climate simulation), and only in 59-75\% of years for the future climate runs. Annual hydropower output was also significantly reduced for the control and future climate simulations. The high sensitivity of reservoir system performance for future climate is a reflection of the fragile equilibrium that now exists in operation of the system, with system demands only slightly less than long-term mean annual inflow.},

	abstract = {All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition to the direct effects on climate-for example, on the frequency of heatwaves-this increase in surface temperatures has important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability-predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions-are likely to be severe. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

This study quantifies how spatial variability in solar radiation affects the spatial and temporal patterns in snow water equivalent ({SWE}), snow chemistry, and snow water isotopes in the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico. Depth, density, stratigraphy, temperature, and snow samples were collected approximately monthly from five locations between January and April 2007 to quantify the effects of solar forcing on snowpack water and chemical balance. Locations varied in solar forcing due to topography and vegetation, while minimizing variability in precipitation, elevation, aspect, interception, and wind redistribution. Snowfall (340 5 mm) was similar across all sites, but peak {SWE} at maximum accumulation ranged from 187 to 340 mm. Solute concentrations were highest directly under canopies, intermediate in nonshaded forest openings, and lowest in shaded forest openings. Conservative solute concentrations ({SO} 42-, R2 = 0.80), Cl- (R2 = 0.60), and isotope values (δ18O R2 = 0.96) were inversely related to {SWE} at maximum accumulation. Mass balance estimates of snowpack water balance using solute concentrations and isotopes indicated that sublimation ranged from {\textless}2\% to ∼20\% of winter precipitation, consistent with previous studies at the site. The strong relationships between solar forcing, {SWE}, and chemistry suggest that snow chemistry at maximum accumulation can be used to estimate overwinter sublimation. Furthermore, variability in solar forcing also can be used to refine spatial estimates of catchment solute and isotope input at melt. Copyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract = {This article applies formal detection and attribution techniques to investigate the nature of observed shifts in the timing of streamflow in the western United States. Previous studies have shown that the snow hydrology of the western United States has changed in the second half of the twentieth century. Such changes manifest themselves in the form of more rain and less snow, in reductions in the snow water contents, and in earlier snowmelt and associated advances in streamflow "center" timing (the day in the "water-year" on average when half the water-year flow at a point has passed). However, with one exception over a more limited domain, no other study has attempted to formally attribute these changes to anthropogenic increases of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using the observations together with a set of global climate model simulations and a hydrologic model (applied to three major hydrological regions of the western United States\_the California region, the upper Colorado River basin, and the Columbia River basin), it is found that the observed trends toward earlier "center" timing of snowmelt-driven streamflows in the western United States since 1950 are detectably different from natural variability (significant at the p {\textless} 0.05 level). Furthermore, the nonnatural parts of these changes can be attributed confidently to climate changes induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, and land use. The signal from the Columbia dominates the analysis, and it is the only basin that showed a detectable signal when the analysis was performed on individual basins. It should be noted that although climate change is an important signal, other climatic processes have also contributed to the hydrologic variability of large basins in the western United States. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

This paper presents a review of methods that are based on groundwater-level data. The water-table fluctuation method may be the most widely used technique for estimating recharge; it requires knowledge of specific yield and changes in water levels over time. Advantages of this approach include its simplicity and an insensitivity to the mechanism by which water moves through the unsaturated zone. Uncertainty in estimates generated by this method relate to the limited accuracy with which specific yield can be determined and to the extent to which assumptions inherent in the method are valid. Other methods that use water levels (mostly based on the Darcy equation) are also described. The theory underlying the methods is explained. Examples from the literature are used to illustrate applications of the different methods.},

The assessment of ecosystem services in biophysical units was an important step to investigate ecosystem functions and actual service ﬂows supporting socio-ecological systems. The Total Economic Value ({TEV}) of all the investigated ecosystem services was about 33 M€/yr, corresponding to 820 €/ha/yr. The provisioning services represented 40\% of the {TEV} while the regulating and cultural services were 49\% and 11\%. The service of hydrogeological protection, particularly important in areas characterized by a high risk of avalanches and landslides, showed a major importance among the regulating services (81\%) and within the {TEV} (40\%). Results from mapping ecosystem services were useful in identifying and visualizing priority areas for different services, as well as exploring trade-offs and synergies between services. Finally, we argue that while a biophysical perspective can ensure a solid accounting base, a comprehensive economic valuation of all categories of forest ecosystem services can facilitate communication of their importance to policy makers.},

	abstract = {Baseﬂow is essential for stream ecosystems and human water uses, particularly in areas with Mediterranean climates. Yet the factors controlling the temporal and spatial variability of baseﬂow and its sources are poorly understood. Measurements of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition (δ18O and δ2H) were used to evaluate controls on baseﬂow in the stream network of a 64‐km2 catchment in western Oregon. A total of 607 water samples were collected to contrast baseﬂow in a year of near average precipitation (2016) to a year with low winter snowpack and subsequent summer drought conditions (2015). Spatial autocorrelation structures and relationships between surface water isotopic signatures and geologic and topographic metrics throughout the network were determined using Spatial Stream Network models. Isotope values varied widely in space and between years, indicating disparate baseﬂow water sources. During average ﬂow conditions, the spatial variation in δ18O was primarily related to elevation, reﬂecting the inﬂuence of prior precipitation and input of water from snowmelt at higher elevation. In contrast, during drought conditions, the spatial variation in δ18O was also related to terrain slope and roughness—proxies for local water storage in deep‐seated earthﬂows and other Quaternary deposits. A prominent spring‐fed tributary with high unit baseﬂow discharge illustrated the importance of subsurface water storage in porous volcanic bedrock. As drought increases in a warming climate, baseﬂow in mountain catchments may become more dependent on storage in geologic and geomorphic features.},

A methodology for filtering noise and non-rainfall-related water table fluctuations is also presented.

	abstract = {In the past, the phrase ‘environmental allocations of water’ has most often been taken to mean allocation of water to rivers. However, it is now accepted that groundwater-dependent ecosystems are an important feature of Australian landscapes and require an allocation of water to maintain their persistence in the landscape. However, moving from this theoretical realisation to the provision and implementation of a field-based management regime is extremely difficult. The following four fundamental questions are identified as being central to the effective management of groundwater-dependent ecosystems ({GDEs}): (1) How do we identify {GDEs} in the field; put another way, which species or species assemblages or habitats are reliant on a supply of groundwater for their persistence in the landscape; (2) what groundwater regime is required to ensure the persistence of a {GDE}; (3) how can managers of natural resources (principally water and habitats), with limited time, money and other resources, successfully manage {GDEs}; and (4) what measures of ecosystem function can be monitored to ensure that management is effective? This paper explicitly addresses these questions and provides a step-by-step theoretical and practical framework for providing answers. In particular, this paper provides an introduction to some of the relevant literature and from this, presents a synthesis, presented in the form of a functional methodology for managing groundwater dependent ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Data obtained from the exploration of the outer solar system has led to a new area of physics: electronically induced sputtering of low-temperature, condensed-gas solids, here referred to as ices. Icy bodies in the outer solar system are bombarded by relatively intense fluxes of ions and electrons, as well as the background solar {UV} flux, causing changes in their optical reflectance and ejection (sputtering/desorption) of molecules from their surfaces. The low cohesive energies of ices lead to relatively large sputtering rates by both momentum transfer (`knock-on' collisions) and the electronic excitations produced by the incident particles. Such sputtering produces an ambient gas about an icy body, often the source of the local plasma. This chapter focuses on the ejection of material by ionizing radiation from a surface that is predominantly a molecular condensed gas solid. The incident radiation types considered are photons, electrons and ions with the emphasis on the ejection processes. This radiation also produces the chemical effects described in the chapters of sections {II} and {III}. The induced-chemistry can produce both more refractory and more volatile products and so affect the molecular ejection rate. The emphasis in this chapter is on the production of gas-phase species from icy surfaces in space. We describe the physics and chemistry leading to the ejection of atoms and molecules, give semi-empirical expressions based on these processes, and describe some applications.},

The electron energy threshold (referenced to the vacuum level) for O2 formation is approximately 10±2 {eV}. This threshold is due to valence level electronic excitations or ionization of condensed water molecules. Comparison of the fluence dependence with kinetic models shows that the formation of O2 is dominated by direct excitation and dissociation of a stable precursor molecule, and not by diffusion and recombination of oxygen atoms. The O2 yield is also strongly dependent upon the temperature of ice, is different for crystalline and amorphous ice films, and is indicative of surface and bulk structural transitions. We demonstrate that electron-stimulated production of O2 is important in radiation processing of low-temperature icy surfaces present on outer solar system bodies. This is particularly true in regions with strong magnetospheres such as the Saturnine and Jovian systems.},

	abstract = {External agents have heavily weathered the visible surface of Europa. Internal and external drivers competing to produce the surface we see include, but are not limited to: aqueous alteration of materials within the icy shell, initial emplacement of endogenic material by geologic activity, implantation of exogenic ions and neutrals from Jupiter's magnetosphere, alteration of surface chemistry by radiolysis and photolysis, impact gardening of upper surface layers, and redeposition of sputtered volatiles. Separating the influences of these processes is critical to understanding the surface and subsurface compositions at Europa. Recent investigations have applied cryogenic reflectance spectroscopy to Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer ({NIMS}) observations to derive abundances of surface materials including water ice, hydrated sulfuric acid, and hydrated sulfate salts. Here we compare derived sulfuric acid hydrate (H2SO4·{nH}2O) abundance with weathering patterns and intensities associated with charged particles from Jupiter's magnetosphere. We present models of electron energy, ion energy, and sulfur ion number flux as well as the total combined electron and ion energy flux at the surface to estimate the influence of these processes on surface concentrations, as a function of location. We found that correlations exist linking both electron energy flux (r∼0.75) and sulfur ion flux (r=0.93) with the observed abundance of sulfuric acid hydrate on Europa. Sulfuric acid hydrate production on Europa appears to be limited in some regions by a reduced availability of sulfur ions, and in others by insufficient levels of electron energy. The energy delivered by sulfur and other ions has a much less significant role. Surface deposits in regions of limited exogenic processing are likely to bear closest resemblance to oceanic composition. These results will assist future efforts to separate the relative influence of endogenic and exogenic sources in establishing the surface composition.},

However, our understanding of the effects of this global phenomenon on groundwater recharge at local and regional scales is limited. Here, we reviewed studies related to (i) recharge estimation methods; (ii) mechanisms by which woody plants impact groundwater recharge; (iii) impacts of woody plant on recharge across different soil and geology; (iv) hydrological repercussions of woody plant removal; and (v) research gaps and needs for groundwater studies. We identiﬁed six different methods: water balance, water table, isotopes, chloride mass balance, electrical geophysical imaging, and modeling were used to study the impact of woody encroachment on groundwater. Woody plant encroachment could alter soil inﬁltration rates, soil water storage, transpiration, interception, and subsurface pathways to affect groundwater recharge. The impact is highly variable, with the extent and the magnitude varying across the soil, substrate, plant cover, and topographic locations. Our review revealed mixed effects of woody plant removal on groundwater recharge. Studies of litter interception, root water uptake, soil moisture dynamics, and deep percolation along with the progression of woody plant encroachment are still limited, warranting further experimental studies focusing on groundwater recharge. Overall, information about woody plant encroachment impacts on groundwater resources across a range of scales is essential for long-range planning of water resources.},

	abstract = {This essay discusses the need for, advantages and challenges of integrating the scientific disciplines of ecology and hydrogeology in the study of groundwater-dependent ecosystems ({GDEs}). We provide a definition for ecohydrogeology as “a unifying, synthetic field of study integrating the approaches from the ecological and hydrogeological sciences in the study of groundwater ({GW})-related ecosystems, habitats, and organisms to advance science, stewardship, and policy”. We selected specific case studies to illustrate first how hydrogeological approaches can favour in-depth understanding and modelling of springs and crenobiontic (spring-dependent) species distribution, assemblage composition and organization. Second, this essay also examines how taxa and assemblages serve as bioassays and ecosystem indicators to infer hydrogeological aspects of {GW} flow and discharge, as well as quantitative and qualitative human impacts. We consider both types of features and parameters as ecohydrogeological indicators. The examples presented include topics related to springs and other {GDE} geomorphological types and classification, {GW} quality influences on crenobiont distribution, phreatophyte (= plant species the roots of which reach to and into the water table) ecophysiology in relation to water table depth, and flow variability in karstic systems, to nutrient dynamics in relation to dinoflagellate blooms in {GDE} montane lakes. Conceptual approaches that integrate ecology with hydrogeology include the investigation of {GDE} distribution and ecology, groundwater-surface water ({GW}-{SW}) interactions, and the development of the discipline of ecohydrology. Despite widespread applications, the scientific community still lacks a complete or effective integration of the principles described in the fields of groundwater hydrogeology with ecology, ecophysiology, and environmental biology. Springs are aquatic-wetland-riparian habitats that link shallow subsurface-surface processes and assemblages, often functioning as biodiversity hotspots, ecotones, keystone, and refugial ecosystems, for which coordination between studies of hydrogeology and ecology are both obvious and essential. Over the past century, springs ecosystem ecology has been largely ignored by hydrologists, and, conversely, hydrogeology has been under-emphasized by ecologists. Recent global recognition of the extraordinary biodiversity and socio-cultural significance of springs, coupled with their globally highly threatened conservation status, stimulated this inquiry into how to better integrate hydrogeology with springs ecosystem ecology. Acknowledging the highly threatened status of springs ecosystems around the world, there is an urgent need to integrate and invigorate the union of these disciplines into ecohydrogeology, the study of groundwater-dependent organisms, habitats, ecosystems, and management policy.},

	abstract = {Spring-fed wetlands are ecologically important habitats in arid and semi-arid regions. Springs have been suggested as possible hydrologic refugia from droughts and climate change; however, springs that depend on recent precipitation or snowmelt for recharge may be vulnerable to warming and drought intensiﬁcation. Springs that are expected to maintain their ecohydrologic function in a warmer, drier climate may be priorities for conservation and restoration. Identifying such springs is difﬁcult because many springs lack hydrologic records of adequate temporal extent and resolution to assess their resilience to water cycle changes. This study demonstrates proof-of-concept for the assessment of certain spring types (i.e., helocrene, hypocrene, and hillslope springs) in terms of hydrologic and ecological resilience to climatic water stress using freely available remote-sensing and climate data. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}) from 1985 through 2011 to delineate surface-moisture zones ({SMZs}) associated with 39 clusters of 172 springs in a montane sage-steppe landscape in southeastern Oregon, {USA}. We developed and synthesized seven {NDVI}-based indicators of {SMZ} resilience to interannual changes in water availability: (1) mean and (2) standard deviation of July {NDVI}; (3) mean difference in July {NDVI} and (4) difference in coefﬁcient of variation for July {NDVI} between each {SMZ} and its surrounding watershed; (5) response of {SMZ} July {NDVI} to 90-day antecedent precipitation; (6) response of {SMZ} July {NDVI} to the previous winter’s snowpack; and (7) range of {NDVI} values from an exceptionally wet year followed by three dry years. Because all resilience indicators were highly inter-correlated, we derived an overall metric of {SMZ} resilience using principal components analysis that accounted for 66\% of total variance. This overall resilience score was positively correlated with {SMZ} elevation, slope, mean annual precipitation, and with the number of associated springs. Resilience was greater for {SMZs} on topographically shaded, north-facing slopes. Several high-resilience {SMZs} were located immediately below persistent snowbanks, suggesting a possible source of steady recharge throughout the growing season. The approach presented here—if combined with ﬁeld assessments of spring hydrogeology, discharge, and groundwater age—could help identify spring-fed wetlands that are most likely to serve as hydrologic refugia from climate change.},

	abstract = {Seasonal low ﬂows are important for sustaining ecosystems and for supplying human needs during the dry season. In California's Sierra Nevada mountains, low ﬂows are primarily sustained by groundwater that is recharged during snowmelt. As the climate warms over the next century, the volume of the annual Sierra Nevada snowpack is expected to decrease by {\textasciitilde}40–90\%. In eight snow-dominated catchments in the Sierra Nevada, we analysed records of snow water equivalent ({SWE}) and unimpaired streamﬂow records spanning 10–33 years. Linear extrapolations of historical {SWE}/streamﬂow relationships suggest that annual minimum ﬂows in some catchments could decrease to zero if peak {SWE} is reduced to roughly half of its historical average. For every 10\% decrease in peak {SWE}, annual minimum ﬂows decrease 9–22\% and occur 3–7 days earlier in the year. In two of the study catchments, Sagehen and Pitman Creeks, seasonal low ﬂows are signiﬁcantly correlated with the previous year's snowpack as well as the current year's snowpack. We explore how future warming could affect the relationship between winter snowpacks and summer low ﬂows, using a distributed hydrologic model Regional Hydro-ecologic Ecosystem Simulation System ({RHESSys}) to simulate the response of two study catchments. Model results suggest that a 10\% decrease in peak {SWE} will lead to a 1–8\% decrease in low ﬂows. The modelled streams do not dry up completely, because the effects of reduced {SWE} are partly offset by increased fall or winter net gains in storage, and by shifts in the timing of peak evapotranspiration. We consider how groundwater storage, snowmelt and evapotranspiration rates, and precipitation phase (snow vs rain) inﬂuence catchment response to warming. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	volume = {28},
	abstract = {Climate change and wildfire are interacting to drive vegetation change and potentially reduce water quantity and quality in the southwestern United States, Forest restoration is a management approach that could mitigate some of these negative outcomes. However, little information exists on how restoration combined with climate change might influence hydrology across large forest landscapes that incorporate multiple vegetation types and complex fire regimes. We combined spatially explicit vegetation and fire modeling with statistical water and sediment yield models for a large forested landscape (335,000 ha) on the Kaibab Plateau in northern Arizona, {USA}. Our objective was to assess the impacts of climate change and forest restoration on the future fire regime, forest vegetation, and watershed outputs. Our model results predict that the combination of climate change and high-severity fire will drive forest turnover, biomass declines, and compositional change in future forests. Restoration treatments may reduce the area burned in high-severity fires and reduce conversions from forested to non-forested conditions. Even though mid-elevation forests are the targets of restoration, the treatments are expected to delay the decline of high-elevation spruce–fir, aspen, and mixed conifer forests by reducing the occurrence of high-severity fires that may spread across ecoregions. We estimate that climate-induced vegetation changes will result in annual runoff declines of up to 10\%, while restoration reduced or reversed this decline. The hydrologic model suggests that mid-elevation forests, which are the targets of restoration treatments, provide around 80\% of runoff in this system and the conservation of mid- to high-elevation forests types provides the greatest benefit in terms of water conservation. We also predict that restoration treatments will conserve water quality by reducing patches of high-severity fire that are associated with high sediment yield. Restoration treatments are a management strategy that may reduce undesirable outcomes for multiple ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {The recent mortality of up to 20\% of forests and woodlands in the southwestern United States, along with declining stream flows and projected future water shortages, heightens the need to understand how management practices can enhance forest resilience and functioning under unprecedented scales of drought and wildfire. To address this challenge, a combination of mechanical thinning and fire treatments are planned for 238,000 hectares (588,000 acres) of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests across central Arizona, {USA}. Mechanical thinning can increase runoff at fine scales, as well as reduce fire risk and tree water stress during drought, but the effects of this practice have not been studied at scales commensurate with recent forest disturbances or under a highly variable climate. Modifying a historical runoff model, we constructed scenarios to estimate increases in runoff from thinning ponderosa pine at the landscape and watershed scales based on driving variables: pace, extent and intensity of forest treatments and variability in winter precipitation. We found that runoff on thinned forests was about 20\% greater than unthinned forests, regardless of whether treatments occurred in a drought or pluvial period. The magnitude of this increase is similar to observed declines in snowpack for the region, suggesting that accelerated thinning may lessen runoff losses due to warming effects. Gains in runoff were temporary (six years after treatment) and modest when compared to mean annual runoff from the study watersheds (0–3\%). Nonetheless gains observed during drought periods could play a role in augmenting river flows on a seasonal basis, improving conditions for water-dependent natural resources, as well as benefit water supplies for downstream communities. Results of this study and others suggest that accelerated forest thinning at large scales could improve the water balance and resilience of forests and sustain the ecosystem services they provide.},

	abstract = {Various techniques are available to quantify recharge; however, choosing appropriate techniques is often difficult. Important considerations in choosing a technique include space/time scales, range, and reliability of recharge estimates based on different techniques; other factors may limit the application of particular techniques. The goal of the recharge study is important because it may dictate the required space/time scales of the recharge estimates. Typical study goals include water-resource evaluation, which requires information on recharge over large spatial scales and on decadal time scales; and evaluation of aquifer vulnerability to contamination, which requires detailed information on spatial variability and preferential flow. The range of recharge rates that can be estimated using different approaches should be matched to expected recharge rates at a site. The reliability of recharge estimates using different techniques is variable. Techniques based on surface-water and unsaturated-zone data provide estimates of potential recharge, whereas those based on groundwater data generally provide estimates of actual recharge. Uncertainties in each approach to estimating recharge underscore the need for application of multiple techniques to increase reliability of recharge estimates.},

	abstract = {Various approaches can be used to simulate groundwater ﬂow in karst systems, including equivalent porous media distributed parameter, lumped parameter, and dual porosity approaches, as well as discrete fracture or conduit approaches. The purpose of this study was to evaluate two different equivalent porous media approaches: lumped and distributed parameter, for simulating regional groundwater ﬂow in a karst aquifer and to evaluate the adequacy of these approaches. The models were applied to the Barton Springs Edwards aquifer, Texas. Unique aspects of this study include availability of detailed information on recharge from stream-loss studies and on synoptic water levels, long-term continuous water level monitoring in wells throughout the aquifer, and spring discharge data to compare with simulation results. The {MODFLOW} code was used for the distributed parameter model. Estimation of hydraulic conductivity distribution was optimized by using a combination of trial and error and automated inverse methods. The lumped parameter model consists of ﬁve cells representing each of the watersheds contributing recharge to the aquifer. Transient simulations were conducted using both distributed and lumped parameter models for a 10-yr period (1989 – 1998). Both distributed and lumped parameter models fairly accurately simulated the temporal variability in spring discharge; therefore, if the objective of the model is to simulate spring discharge, either distributed or lumped parameter approaches can be used. The distributed parameter model generally reproduced the potentiometric surface at different times. The impact of the amount of pumping on a regional scale on spring discharge can be evaluated using a lumped parameter model; however, more detailed evaluation of the effect of pumping on groundwater levels and spring discharge requires a distributed parameter modeling approach. Sensitivity analyses indicated that spring discharge was much more sensitive to variations in recharge than pumpage, indicating that aquifer management should consider enhanced recharge, in addition to conservation measures, to maintain spring ﬂow. This study shows the ability of equivalent porous media models to simulate regional groundwater ﬂow in a highly karstiﬁed aquifer, which is important for water resources and groundwater management. q 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Understory evapotranspiration ({EU}) was estimated from the difference between throughfall precipitation and changes in soil water content measured in trenched plots that excluded tree roots. The thinning treatment in 2001 reduced plot basal area by 82\% and leaf area index by 45\%. Difference in stand-level evapotranspiration (E) between the thinned and unthinned plots, and partitioning of E between {EU} and {EO} during the ﬁrst post-treatment summer and spring, varied between drought and non-drought periods. The importance of {EU} in stand-level E was greater in thinned compared with unthinned plots and increased during extreme drought when {EO} was low due to stomatal closure.

Simulations were conducted to examine how tree basal area reductions impact groundwater recharge from historic conditions to 2099. Novel spatial analyses were conducted to determine areas and rates of potential increases in groundwater recharge. Changes in recharge were applied to the model by identifying zones of basal area reduction from planned forest restoration treatments and applying recharge-change factors to these zones. Over a 10-year period of forest restoration treatment, a 2.8\% increase in recharge to one adjacent groundwater basin (the Verde Valley sub-basin) was estimated, compared to conditions that existed from 2000 to 2005. However, this increase in recharge was assumed to quickly decline after treatment due to regrowth of vegetation and forest underbrush and their associated increased evapotranspiration. Furthermore, simulated increases in groundwater recharge were masked by decreases in water levels, stream baseﬂow, and groundwater storage resulting from surface water diversions and groundwater pumping. These results indicate that there is an imbalance between water supply and demand in this regional, semi-arid aquifer. Current water management practices may not be sustainable into the far future and comprehensive action should be taken to minimize this water budget imbalance.},

Applying these principles will help avoid common pitfalls in river restoration, such as creating habitat types that are outside of a site’s natural potential, attempting to build static habitats in dynamic environments, or constructing habitat features that are ultimately overwhelmed by unconsidered system drivers.},

By the 1980s, however, most optimal sites were developed or protected through conservation policies. Today, climate change and growing water demands pose new challenges for water management. Consequently, policy-makers are once again advocating for water storage. In the U.S. and other developed countries, this return to supply-side solutions is manifesting in auxiliary infrastructural projects such as dam augmentation and aquifer storage and recovery ({ASR}). We argue that the return to a high-modernist reliance on big infrastructure is not limited to developing countries and illustrate the rise of auxiliary infrastructure using two case studies in California and Oregon. Our analysis suggests these auxiliary infrastructural projects are appealing to water managers because they purport to accommodate the demand for new water-governance strategies while working within the limitations imposed by past infrastructural development and environmental policy. Nevertheless, increasing storage capacity alone is insufficient for water management in the context of climate change, for demand-side strategies must also be pursued.},

These results are robust to perturbation of study variates and methods. They portend, in conjunction with previous work, a coming crisis in water supply for the western United States.},

Hydrologic modeling directed at quantifying these potential changes has focused on the magnitude and timing of spring snowmelt as the key control on the spatial–temporal pattern of summer streamflow. We illustrate how spatial differences in groundwater dynamics can also play a significant role in determining streamflow responses to warming. We examine two contrasting watersheds, one located in the Western Cascades and the other in the High Cascades mountains of Oregon. We use both empirical analysis of streamflow data and physically based, spatially distributed modeling to disentangle the relative importance of multiple and interacting controls. In particular, we explore the extent to which differences in snow accumulation and melt and drainage characteristics (deep ground water vs. shallow subsurface) mediate the effect of climate change. Results show that within the Cascade Range, local variations in bedrock geology and concomitant differences in volume and seasonal fluxes of subsurface water will likely result in significant spatial variability in responses to climate forcing. Specifically, watersheds dominated by High Cascade geology will show greater absolute reductions in summer streamflow with predicted temperature increases.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The major tributary of the lower Colorado River, the Gila River, is a critical source of water for human and natural environments in the southwestern United States. Warmer and drier than the upper Colorado River basin, with less snow and a bimodal precipitation regime, the Gila River is controlled by a set of climatic conditions that is different from the controls on upper Colorado River flow. Unlike the Colorado River at Lees Ferry in Arizona, the upper Gila River and major Gila River tributaries, the Salt and Verde Rivers, do not yet reflect significant declines in annual streamflow, despite warming trends. Annual streamflow is dominated by cool-season precipitation, but the monsoon influence is discernable as well, variable across the basin and complicated by an inverse relationship with cool-season precipitation in the Salt and Verde River basins. Major multiyear streamflow droughts in these two basins have frequently been accompanied by wet monsoons, suggesting that monsoon precipitation may partially offset the impacts of a dry cool season. While statistically significant trends in annual streamflow are not evident, decreases in autumn and spring streamflow reflect warming temperatures and some decreases in spring precipitation. Because climatic controls vary with topography and the influence of the monsoon, the impact of warming on streamflow in the three subbasins is somewhat variable. However, given relationships between climate and streamflow, current trends in hydroclimate, and projections for the future, it would be prudent to expect declines in Gila River water supplies in the coming decades.
            
              Significance Statement
              This research investigates the climatic controls on the Gila River and its major tributaries, the Verde and Salt Rivers, to gain insights on how trends in climate may impact future water supply. The Gila River is the major tributary of the lower Colorado River, but, unlike the situation for the upper Colorado River, no significant decreasing trends in annual streamflow are evident despite warming temperatures. Climate–streamflow relationships are more complex in this part of the Colorado River basin, and several factors may be buffering streamflow to the impact of warming. However, given the key climatic controls on streamflow, current and emerging trends in climate, and projections for the future, declines in streamflow should be expected in the future.},

Many streams have incised because of changing climate or land-use practices. Because incised streams provide limited benefits to biota, they are a common focus of restoration efforts. Contemporary models of long-term change in streams are focused primarily on physical characteristics, and most restoration efforts are also focused on manipulating physical rather than ecological processes. We present an alternative view, that stream restoration is an ecosystem process, and suggest that the recovery of incised streams is largely dependent on the interaction of biogenic structures with physical fluvial processes. In particular, we propose that live vegetation and beaver dams or beaver dam analogues can substantially accelerate the recovery of incised streams and can help create and maintain complex fluvial ecosystems.},

Extended drought in the Upper Colorado River Basin ({UCOL}) and the prospect of a warmer climate in the future pose water availability challenges for those charged with managing the river. Limited water availability in the future also may negatively affect aquatic ecosystems and wildlife that depend upon them. Water availability components of special importance in the {UCOL} include streamflow, salinity in groundwater and surface water, groundwater levels and storage, and the role of snow in the {UCOL} water cycle. This manuscript provides a review of current “state of the science” for these {UCOL} water availability components with a focus on identifying gaps in data, modeling, and trends in the basin. Trends provide context for evaluations of current conditions and motivation for further investigation and modeling, models allow for investigation of processes and projections of future water availability, and data support both efforts.

Snowpack and snowfall levels have declined, snowmelt and peak spring flows are arriving earlier, and summer flows have declined. Concurrent to climate change and variation, a century of fire suppression has resulted in dramatic changes to forest conditions, and yet, few studies have focused on determining the degree to which changing forests have altered flows. In this study, we evaluated changes in flow, climate, and forest conditions in the Salt River in central Arizona from 1914–2012 to compare and evaluate the effects of changing forest conditions and temperatures on flows. After using linear regression models to remove the influence of precipitation and temperature, we estimated that annual flows declined by 8–29\% from 1914–1963, coincident with a 2-fold increase in basal area, a 2-3-fold increase in canopy cover, and at least a 10-fold increase in forest density within ponderosa pine forests. Streamflow volumes declined by 37–56\% in summer and fall months during this period. Declines in climate-adjusted flows reversed at mid-century when spring and annual flows increased by 10–31\% from 1964–2012, perhaps due to more winter rainfall. Additionally, peak spring flows occurred about 12 days earlier in this period than in the previous period, coincident with winter and spring temperatures that increased by 1–2˚C. While uncertainties remain, this study adds to the knowledge gained in other regions that forest change has had effects on flow that were on par with climate variability and, in the case of mid-century declines, well before the influence of anthropogenic warming. Current large-scale forest restoration projects hold some promise of recovering seasonal flows.},

Considering predicted future imbalances between water supply and demand and the growing recognition that base ﬂow (a proxy for groundwater discharge to streams) is critical for sustaining ﬂow in streams and rivers, there is a need to develop methods to better quantify present-day base ﬂow across large regions. We adapted and applied the spatially referenced regression on watershed attributes ({SPARROW}) water quality model to assess the spatial distribution of base ﬂow, the fraction of streamﬂow supported by base ﬂow, and estimates of and potential processes contributing to the amount of base ﬂow that is lost during in-stream transport in the Upper Colorado River Basin ({UCRB}). On average, 56\% of the streamﬂow in the {UCRB} originated as base ﬂow, and precipitation was identiﬁed as the dominant driver of spatial variability in base ﬂow at the scale of the {UCRB}, with the majority of base ﬂow discharge to streams occurring in upper elevation watersheds. The model estimates an average of 1.8 3 1010 m3/yr of base ﬂow in the {UCRB}; greater than 80\% of which is lost during in-stream transport to the Lower Colorado River Basin via processes including evapotranspiration and water diversion for irrigation. Our results indicate that surface waters in the Colorado River Basin are dependent on base ﬂow, and that management approaches that consider groundwater and surface water as a joint resource will be needed to effectively manage current and future water resources in the Basin.},

Baseﬂow data were derived from daily streamﬂow records with a recursive digital ﬁlter method for baseﬂow separation for 22 watersheds in Indiana. Filtered average annual baseﬂow varies between 150 and 320 mm for the study watersheds. {BFI} varies between 0.40 to 0.88 with an average of 0.60, suggesting that 60\% of long-term streamﬂow in Indiana is likely supported by ground water discharge and shallow subsurface ﬂow. Three regression equations (one for baseﬂow and one for {BFI}) were developed and evaluated in the study watersheds. Results showed that the models reasonably estimate baseﬂow with relative errors ({RE}) ranging from 0\% to 30\%, except in one watershed where the {RE} was 50\% during the validation period. These equations can be used to estimate baseﬂow and {BFI} at ungauged sites in Indiana. The present work would have implications for improving the capabilities of simple hydrologic/ water quality models, and support planning and management of water resources. The methodology used in this study can be applied in other locations and regions.},

Substantial surface and groundwater use within the Little Colorado River ({LCR}) basin threatens the water sources of the confluence, springs in the {LCR} basin, and specifically the Hopi Sipapuni—a sacred site of cultural emergence. To address concerns about diminished flows of sacred springs, we engaged in praxis through collaborative, reciprocal, communitybased research processes. Through the lens of anticolonial theory, we ask: Can federal policies be employed in an anticolonial pursuit of water and sacred site protection? How do Indigenous grassroots organizers envision protection and work to re-Indigenize water management? Semi-structured interviews with Indigenous community organizers and federal land managers were coupled with policy analysis of the National Historic Preservation Act/Traditional Cultural Properties, the ongoing {LCR} Adjudication, and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Findings point to multifaceted, complex, and contradictory themes that elucidate the continued influence of colonization on water governance and the degree to which protection solutions can be anticolonial. Criteria were generated for anticolonial protective pathways that highlight the centrality of reciprocal relationships, Indigenous Knowledges, and meaningful inclusion. While details about protection pathways for the confluence and Sipapuni are many, the salient finding is that the struggle for water protection in the {LCR} is the struggle for protection of inherent Indigenous rights.},

            Collaborative, or participatory governance is an increasingly common means of addressing natural resource issues, especially in the American West where patchworks of public, private, and tribal interests characterize the region’s resources. In this context, unlikely alliances, or partnerships among diverse actors who have historically been at odds, have a growing potential to shape social and ecological outcomes, for better or worse. While these unlikely alliances have received greater attention in recent years, relatively little research has worked to synthesize the concept across diverse contexts and disciplines. Based on a review of the literature on unlikely alliances in natural resource governance, we develop a framework that synthesizes the individual motivations and contextual factors that influence their formation, as well as the social and ecological outcomes that they create. We use this framework to analyze six illustrative cases of unlikely alliances. Our analysis of these cases suggests that unlikely alliances in the American West are likely to arise in the presence of a crisis, when appropriate leadership is present, when some of the actors have interacted effectively in the past, and when actors need to pool resources. The cases also illustrate some common outcomes, including environmental improvement, transformation of social networks, policy change, and shifts in power relationships. We discuss the implications of unlikely alliances for the social-ecological future of the American West. Our paper highlights the role of unlikely alliances in shaping patterns of natural resource governance, and provides a focus for further research in this realm.},

The assertion of Native American water rights on highly developed water systems in North America has triggered governance innovations that resemble certain aspects of adaptive governance, and have emerged to accommodate the need for Indigenous water development and restoration of cultural and ecological resources. Similar innovations are observed in the assertion of Indigenous voices in Australia. This presents an opportunity to analyze the emergence of adaptive processes within complex legal systems. We explore the role of law in locally driven innovation in this context, concluding that any system of governance that requires greater ﬂexibility will only be viewed as legitimate, and thus succeed, if attention is given not only to adaptive capacity, but also to aspects of good governance. Through examples of the assertion of Indigenous rights, we illustrate critical links between adaptive capacity in water management, good governance, and law.},

	abstract = {Historical records indicate that gray wolves (Canis lupus) were extirpated from the upper Gallatin River Basin in the early 1900s. Following the removal of these large carnivores, elk (Cervis elaphus) began to increasingly browse streamside vegetation in the winter range, causing widespread loss of formerly extensive willow (Salix spp.) communities. Historical aerial photographs and chronosequences of ground photographs were used to characterize general changes in vegetation and channel morphology over time. In August of 2004, riparian vegetation and channel cross-sections were surveyed along three reaches of the upper Gallatin River. Reach A was located upstream of the elk winter range (control reach) whereas reaches B and C (treatment reaches) were located within the elk winter range. Willow cover on ﬂoodplains averaged 85 per cent for reach A, but only 26 per cent and 5 per cent for reaches B and C, respectively. The average return period of calculated bankfull discharges was 3·1 yrs for reach A but increased to 32·4 yrs and 10·6 yrs for reaches B and C, respectively. The long-term loss of streamside vegetation allowed channels to generally increase in hydraulic capacity (via increases in width, incision or both) and decrease their hydrologic connectivity with adjacent ﬂoodplains. This study documents, perhaps for the ﬁrst time, the resultant impacts to riparian vegetation functions and stream channel characteristics following the extirpation of a large mammalian carnivore.

	abstract = {Northern Yellowstone National Park provides an example of passive restoration, as wetlands and riparian areas there lost most tall willows in the 20th century, due to intensive herbivory by elk (Cervus canadensis). Following large carnivore restoration in the late 1990s, elk numbers decreased, and some researchers reported willows growing taller with reductions in browsing, evidence of a shift toward willow recovery. Others questioned the extent and signiﬁcance of these changes. To investigate how willow heights have changed in northern Yellowstone since the 1990s, and to assess the importance of browsing as a driver of willow height and canopy cover, we compared data from three time periods: 1988 to 1993 when elk densities were high and most willows very short, 2001 to 2004 when willows may have begun to recover, and 2016 to 2018. We found a strong contrast between sites along streams, compared to wet meadows (meadow sites). Willows in meadow sites did not increase in height, but willows in stream sites increased signiﬁcantly, exceeding 200 cm mean height in summer by 2001–2004, and in spring by 2016, a height indicative of recovery. Where height did not increase, this was due to loss of annual growth to herbivory. Overall willow height distribution changed from mostly short to become clearly bimodal, with a new peak around 300–400 cm. Bison increased, and in some sites where bison congregate willows remained suppressed at heights below 120 cm, a condition strongly correlated with summer browsing. We also located and measured willow thickets (groups of 5 of more willows {\textgreater}200 cm spring height and {\textless}2 m apart) along streams in the study area. We found willow thickets in all stream reaches surveyed, a signiﬁcant change from past conditions. Thickets occupied {\textgreater}80\% of willow patches in some sites, but as little as 22\% in others. Tall willow thickets are an important habitat feature and an indicator of willow recovery. Our results demonstrate that the reduction of elk herbivory over the last two decades in northern Yellowstone has allowed willows to grow taller in many places, despite a warming and drying climate, while increased herbivory by bison continues to suppress willows in some locations.},

	abstract = {Monitoring, assessment and reporting of stream restoration projects have historically lagged far behind implementation. However, in recent years, rigorous post-project assessments ({PPAs}) of modern stream restoration practices have steadily increased. This has helped to stimulate debate and inquiry regarding the effectiveness of restoration techniques and has provided critical feedback to practitioners and planners useful in restoration design and implementation. Nonetheless, few studies exist that track the performance of modern restoration projects over a protracted period. Instead, most are based on a brief snapshot taken during the initial post-construction period, which may not always accurately characterize longer-term project performance. Here, we re-visit a stream restoration project implemented in 2005 on a third-order stream in central New York. By repeating several of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation procedures from the original 2007 {PPA} we demonstrate that (i) despite several recent large ﬂood events and the fact that the current channel geometry differs from the design/as-built conﬁguration, the project has made substantial progress towards the goals of channel stabilization and habitat enhancement; (ii) this more favourable, mid-term outcome was not necessarily evident during or well-predicted by our 2007 {PPA}; (iii) although continued deformation of in-stream structures may be a harbinger of future channel instability, riparian vegetation is playing an increasingly important role in maintaining channel stability; and (iv) accurately predicting local scour depths proximal to in-stream structures, performing a detailed sediment budget analysis, and prescribing adequate bank protection are critical to project success, especially during early stages of a project.

Although high natural background concentrations may occur in some environments (Runnells et al. 1992), anthropogenic contamination concerns are especially troublesome on the Navajo Nation ({NN}), where past U mining activity may have contaminated water supplies. This research investigated U and As groundwater contamination issues in unregulated wells in the western portion of the {NN}. Objectives of this research were to provide insights to human health risks by assessing the spatial extent and seasonal variability of U and As concentrations while effectively communicating the potential contamination risks to the local Navajo people. Eighty-two unregulated wells were sampled in 2018; nine of these sources exceeded the maximum contaminant level ({MCL}) for drinking water standards for U (30 µg/L), and 14 exceeded the {MCL} for drinking water standards for As (10 µg/L). U and As levels were highest in the southwest portion of the study area and seasonal variability was observed in a subset of wells, especially shallower hand dug wells and hand pumps. The results were compiled into a report that was presented to {NN} chapters included in the study as well as the Navajo Department of Water Resources and the {NN} Environmental Protection Agency. Implications for regional water quality patterns can help to direct policy recommendations for well monitoring, water use, and remediation targets.},

Speciﬁc Indigenous peoples maintain distinct and multifaceted sociocultural relations to water, yet the legacy of colonialism globally means that communities around the world face similar challenges to protecting these relations. The role of Indigenous peoples and their sociocultural relations to water is currently under acknowledged in the water governance literature. Through a case study of the Koyukon Athabascan people of Ruby, Alaska, this article examines how the explicit analysis of hydrosocial relations facilitates conceptualization of Indigenous water governance. Participatory research methods involving semistructured interviews and traditional use mapping were employed to document the hydrosocial relations of the people of Ruby, which water law and policy in Alaska does not adequately recognize. This study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, an engagement with the hydrosocial literature makes explicit the distinct sociocultural relations to water maintained by all human communities and the existence of these multiple normative orders within the same political space, where the hydrosocial relations of some populations are privileged over others. Second, it contributes to the conceptualization of Indigenous water governance by exploring the extent to which Indigenous peoples in the Yukon River Basin, including the people of Ruby, are engaging in multiple strategies to assert their sovereignty. These strategies include recognition-based approaches such as litigation to gain legal recognition of Indigenous water rights and Indigenous alternatives without reference to state recognition such as the development of community-based water monitoring programs.},

	abstract = {Climate change is altering the distribution of woody plants by influencing demographic processes and modifying disturbance regimes. Trailing-edge forests may be particularly vulnerable to these effects because they exist at warm, dry margins of tree distributions. To better understand recent climate-driven changes in trailing-edge forests, we used Landsat time series and 1558 field reference plots to develop annual land cover maps from 1985 to 2020 in two large, biodiverse landscapes in central Arizona, {USA}. We then combined annual land cover maps with tree ring records and spatial data describing interannual climate, terrain, bark beetle (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) activity, wildfire, and harvest to quantify drivers of forest change. Throughout the two landscapes, forest extent declined by 0.3 \% and 0.8 \% from 1985 to 2020. However, considerable variation occurred within the study period, with abrupt (ca. 1–2 years) declines in forest extent followed by gradual (ca. 10 years) recovery on each landscape. Pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis, Pinus monophylla, and/or Juniperus spp.) cover increased from 1985 to ca. 2000 but declined after 2000, a period of extreme drought and regional tree die-off. In contrast, pineoak (Pinus ponderosa and Quercus spp.) cover increased from 2000 to 2020, primarily due to declines in pon­ derosa pine and mixed conifer cover over the same period. Wildfire was a key driver of transitions from forest to non-forest cover in our study area, with the occurrence of multiple compounded drought years playing an important role in unburned areas. By driving transitions to alternative forest types or non-forest cover, distur­ bance and drought will increasingly shape forest dynamics and ecosystem transformations throughout the southwestern {US}.},

	abstract = {Recursive digital ﬁltering of hydrographs is a widely used method to identify streamﬂow components, which react to precipitation with varying degrees of attenuation and delay. In this context, a distinction is often made between physically based and non-physically based algorithms. A well-known example of a physically based algorithm is that of Furey and Gupta (2001). In this paper, it is contrasted with the widely used algorithm of Eckhardt (2005). This algorithm is often considered merely a non-physically based low-pass ﬁlter. However, the comparison shows that both algorithms largely agree. The algorithm of Eckhardt (2005) differs from the algorithm of Furey and Gupta (2001) only in the time delay assumed between precipitation and the exﬁltration of baseﬂow into surface waters and in the fact that two parameters are combined into one, {BFImax}. This parameter can thus be interpreted physically, and an approach for its calculation emerges.},

	abstract = {Water in the Colorado River, {USA}, is known to be a highly over-allocated resource, yet managers and decision makers rarely consider one of the most important contributions to the existing water in the river, i.e. groundwater. This oversight may result from the contrasting results of base-flow studies conducted on the amount of streamflow into the Colorado River sourced from groundwater. Some studies rule out the significance of groundwater contribution, while others show groundwater contributing the majority of flow to the river. This study uses new and extant instrumented data (not indirect methods) to quantify the groundwater base-flow contribution to surface flow. The precipitation, streamflow, and base flow of 10 remote subbasins of the Colorado Plateau in southern Utah and northern Arizona were examined in detail. These tributaries have an annual average base-flow discharge of 0.45 km3/year (367,000 acre-feet per year) with an average base-flow fraction of 72\% summing to more than 3\% of the mean flow of the Colorado River at Phantom Ranch. The groundwater storage trend of the Colorado River Basin when measured with remote sensing is declining; however, when utilizing instrumented data, the average annual base-flow trend in the study area remains constant. This trend suggests that base-flow signatures in streams may have a delayed response from the decline observed in groundwater storage from remote sensing. The simple extant data measurement methods employed in this study can be applied to the entire drainage basin, revealing the quantity of base flow throughout the basin to better inform water resource management.},

The magnitude of event peak ﬂow, event quick ﬂow, event water yield, and event response time did not change after thinning. Because 70\% of rainfall events had multiple ﬂow peaks, relationships between each ﬂow peak and the rainfall just prior to that peak were also analyzed. The increases in accumulated quick ﬂow, ﬂow rise and ﬂow drop were signiﬁcant after thinning. The ﬂow drop following each ﬂow peak increased, and led to a lower initial ﬂow in subsequent peaks, resulting in no increase in peak size. The ﬂow peaks in events with over 30 mm rainfall amount and over 2 mm/h average rainfall intensity showed signiﬁcant increases in ﬂow peak, ﬂow rise, ﬂow drop, and accumulated quick ﬂow, which suggests that the catchment exhibited more shallow ﬂow paths during large rainfall amounts after thinning. No changes were identiﬁed using event-based analysis, but changes in ﬂow peaks were detected, which indicates the importance of examining all ﬂow peaks when investigating rainfall-runoff characteristics of headwater catchments.},

	abstract = {Restoring and enhancing riparian vegetation on private and communal lands in Mexico is important for biodiversity conservation given the ecological significance of these areas and the scarcity of public protected areas. To enhance riparian vegetation and wildlife habitats and train local people in restoration techniques, we implemented restoration and outreach efforts on private and communal lands in the Sky Islands region of northwest Mexico. We fenced 475 ha of riparian zones from livestock, erected erosion-control structures, planted trees, and developed management agreements for cool-season grazing with landowners on 10 ranches across 3 sites in 2012-2013, then repaired fences and renegotiated agreements in 2017-2019. To foster evaluation, we used a before-after/control-impact design to measure attributes of vegetation structure and bird communities and compared baselines from 2012 with post-treatment estimates from 2019. As predicted, understory vegetation volume generally increased in treatments relative to controls (P = .09), especially when one treatment area with the lowest pre-treatment grazing impacts was censored (P = .01). Although canopy cover also increased, there was little differential change in treatments relative to controls (P ⩾ .23) due likely to longer time periods needed to realize responses. Densities of most focal bird populations varied across time periods in directions that typically matched observed changes in vegetation structure, but fewer species showed signs of differential positive change linked to treatments relative to controls. Densities of Yellow-breasted Chat, a key understory obligate and important focal species, increased in treatments relative to controls across sites, as did densities of Sinaloa Wren, which also use dense underbrush (P ⩽ .05). Positive changes by other understory obligates (eg, Common Yellowthroat, Song Sparrow) were more local but sometimes of high magnitude ({\textgreater}8-fold) also suggesting positive impacts of treatments. Despite mixed results over a limited time period, these patterns suggest restoration efforts drove localized recovery of understory vegetation and associated bird populations, but benefits varied widely with environmental and social factors linked to management. Greater ecological benefits to riparian areas on private and communal lands in this region can be fostered by further incentivizing construction, maintenance, and proper use of restoration infrastructure, through education, and by building relationships based on trust and credibility with landowners.},

              Beaver have been referred to as ecosystem engineers because of the large impacts their dam building activities have on the landscape; however, the benefits they may provide to fluvial fish species has been debated. We conducted a watershed-scale experiment to test how increasing beaver dam and colony persistence in a highly degraded incised stream affects the freshwater production of steelhead (
              Oncorhynchus mykiss
              ). Following the installation of beaver dam analogs ({BDAs}), we observed significant increases in the density, survival and production of juvenile steelhead without impacting upstream and downstream migrations. The steelhead response occurred as the quantity and complexity of their habitat increased. This study is the first large-scale experiment to quantify the benefits of beavers and {BDAs} to a fish population and its habitat. Beaver mediated restoration may be a viable and efficient strategy to recover ecosystem function of previously incised streams and to increase the production of imperiled fish populations.},

	abstract = {Channel incision is a widespread phenomenon throughout the dry interior Columbia River basin and other semi-arid regions of the world, which degrades stream habitat by fundamentally altering natural ecological, geomorphological and hydrological processes. We examined the extent of localized aggradation behind beaver dams on an incised stream in the interior Columbia River basin to assess the potential for using beaver, Castor canadensis, dams to restore such channels, and the effect of the aggradation on riparian habitat. We estimated aggradation rates behind 13 beaver dams between 1 and 6 years old on Bridge Creek, a tributary to the John Day River in eastern Oregon. Vertical aggradation rates are initially rapid, as high as 0·47 m yr−1, as the entrenched channel ﬁlls, then level off to 0·075 m yr−1 by year six, as the sediment begins accumulating on adjacent terraces. We found that a 0·5 m elevation contour above the stream channel approximately coincided with the extent of new riparian vegetation establishment. Therefore, we compared the area surrounding reaches upstream of beaver dams that were within 0·5 m elevation of the stream channel with adjacent reaches where no dams existed. We found that there was ﬁve times more area within 0·5 m elevation of the channel upstream of beaver dams, presumably because sediment accumulation had aggraded the channel. Our results suggest that restoration strategies that encourage the recolonization of streams by beaver can rapidly expand riparian habitat along incised streams.

	abstract = {This study investigated how sporadic river datasets could be used to quantify temporal variations in the base flow index ({BFI}). The {BFI} represents the baseflow component of river flow which is often used as a proxy indicator for groundwater discharge to a river. The Bua catchment in Malawi was used as a case study, whereby the smoothed minima method was applied to river flow data from six gauges (ranging from 1953 to 2009) and the Mann-Kendall ({MK}) statistical test was used to identify trends in {BFI}. The results showed that baseflow plays an important role within the catchment. Average annual {BFIs} {\textgreater} 0.74 were found for gauges in the lower reaches of the catchment, in contrast to lower {BFIs} {\textless} 0.54 which were found for gauges in the higher reaches. Minimal difference between annual and wet season {BFI} was observed, however dry season {BFI} was {\textgreater}0.94 across all gauges indicating the importance of baseflow in maintaining any dry season flows. Long term trends were identified in the annual and wet season {BFI}, but no evidence of a trend was found in the dry season {BFI}. Sustainable management of the investigated catchment should, therefore, account for the temporal variations in baseflow, with special regard to water resources allocation within the region and consideration in future scheme appraisals aimed at developing water resources. Further, this demonstration of how to work with sporadic river data to investigate baseflow serves as an important example for other catchments faced with similar challenges.},

	abstract = {Understanding patterns of groundwater flow are important when quantifying and mitigating threats to critical groundwater resources. Environmental tracers, determined from discrete sampling, could aid in characterizing spring systems through determining flow paths, recharge areas, and carbon cycling. This study explores the novel inclusion of δ13C of dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}), δ13C of dissolved inorganic carbon ({DIC}) and fluorescent dissolved organic matter ({fDOM}), along with more commonly used multi-tracer approaches that involve water isotopes, major ions, and saturation indices, to characterize springs of the Shivwits Plateau in Grand Canyon National Park, {USA}. Carbon isotope ratios and {fDOM} concentrations for all springs reflect source values associated with regional surface vegetation and heterotrophic degradation of terrestrial {DOM}. Principal component analyses show that springs can be grouped by geochemical variability into: (1) a shallow epikarst system, (2) a flow path through gypsiferous beds of the Toroweap Formation on the eastern side of the plateau, (3) a short canyon-slope flow path dominated by runoff, and (4) a deeper complex flow system in the Redwall Limestone characteristic of mixing of all other flow systems. As appropriations from the Colorado River already exceed its annual streamflow, characterizing groundwater resources for water supply in an increasingly arid climate will be paramount. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of geochemical techniques for groundwater flow characterization, particularly in inaccessible environments.},

	abstract = {Large-scale changes in forest structure and ecological function throughout western North America have led to increased frequency, size, and severity of wildfires. The {US} Forest Service is implementing state-wide forest restoration initiatives to reduce wildfire hazards and improve forest health. We provide a synthesis of pre- and post-treatment forest vegetation and ecosystem moisture trends between 1990 and 2017 in Arizona, the first {US} state where the initiative has implemented a variety of thinning and burning methods in over 1,200 polygon areas across 3.5 million ha. Using 4,426 Landsat satellite images on Google Earth Engine, we calculated normalized difference moisture index ({NDMI}), normalized difference water index ({NDWI}), and normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) to create dense time-series datasets. The indices and 1990-2017 annual total precipitation dataset were then examined using a Mann–Kendall tau test to identify statistically significant upward and downward trends for each pixel. Our results indicate that much of the study region were experiencing drought conditions prior to restoration treatments and {NDVI} values were significantly decreasing, especially during the dry spring season. However, both {NDMI} and {NDWI} trends indicate that the forest restoration treatments have contributed to increased total ecosystem moisture, while precipitation in the post-treatment period exhibit stable trends. Forest restoration treatments appear to have improved the overall forest health and resiliency to drought, especially during the dry spring season, when forests are most vulnerable to water stress and wildfire risks. Our results of the spatial patterns and long-term trends in these variables can inform the currently ongoing and future restoration treatments to better target the treatment strategy across the southwestern {USA}. Google Earth Engine enabled our synthesis of these long-term trends over the large region and will enhance our continued monitoring in the coming decade.},

Karst terrain often develops from an ancestral landscape of surface-flowing streams, which leaves behind a relict pattern of the surface watershed divides. If caves only developed in ancestral watersheds, then groundwater tracing, for the purpose of groundwater basin mapping, would be unnecessary. But lithologic, structural, and hydrologic factors conspire to ensure that some caves extend headward faster than their neighbors and encroach upon adjacent groundwater basins to pirate drainage under the original surface divides. In many areas, groundwater basin boundaries have been significantly reorganized, to the point that there is little relationship to the ancestral surface watershed boundaries.},

	abstract = {Understanding the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological processes, especially the baseflow, is vital for sustainable water resource management. We analyzed the global changes in baseflow and baseflow index ({BFI}) for 2,374 global streamflow stations from 1970 to 2016 to examine their associations with precipitation, temperature, terrestrial water storage ({TWS}), normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) representing the vegetation regimes, potential evapotranspiration ({PET}), and a humidity index ({HI})-precipitation/{PET}. Results showed that changes in both baseflow and {BFI} are significantly region dependent in continents, due to spatial differences of changes in climate and vegetation that determines the baseflow generation. Seasonal baseflow changed slightly, while seasonal {BFI} varied greatly, partly due to the shift from snowfall to rainfall and warming effects on glacial retreat and the timing of snowmelt. The multibasin baseflow elasticity analyses show that baseflow ({BFI}) was highly sensitive to changes in {NDVI}, precipitation, and temperature (temperature and {PET}). The multivariate regression analyses show that globally, changes in precipitation and {TWS} contributed to the majority (64.8\% and 20.2\%) of changes in baseflow, while changes in {HI}, {PET}, and precipitation contributed to the majority (30.3\%, 28.9\%, and 27.5\%) of changes in {BFI}. The spatially varying interaction between climate, vegetation, and baseflow implies that regional adaptation of water resources utilization to climate change should consider the regional shifts in vegetation. This study quantified the elasticity and relative contribution of changes in geographic factors to changes in baseflow and {BFI} around the world and could inform practices for sustainable water management.},

We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing {RF} to other common classification methods.

Herein, long-term observational data was used to evaluate the stability and reliability of baseflow estimation. Seven baseflow separation methods were compared with the mass balance filter ({MBF}) as a reference method. Here, two indicators including the average annual baseflow coefficient ({BFC}) and the baseflow index ({BFI}) were used to assess the impact of climate condition on baseflow separation. In addition, we investigated two sources of uncertainty in the digital filter methods: the recession constant (α) value and the approximation of groundwater recharge.},

	abstract = {Recursive digital ﬁltering of hydrographs is a baseﬂow separation method that can easily be automated and has been recommended for providing reproducible results. In the past, different formulations of the most simple ﬁlter type, the so-called one-parameter ﬁlter, have been proposed. In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed for ﬁlter algorithms that were constructed under the assumption that the outﬂow from an aquifer is linearly proportional to its storage. It is shown that these one-parameter ﬁlters describing an exponential baseﬂow recession are all special cases of a two-parameter ﬁlter whose equation is speciﬁed. Its parameters are the recession constant—which can be objectively determined by a recession analysis—and {BFImax}, the maximum value of the baseﬂow index that can be modelled by the algorithm. This introduces a subjective element into the baseﬂow calculation, since {BFImax} is not measurable. A preliminary analysis based on the results of conventional separation techniques shows that it might be possible to ﬁnd typical {BFImax} values for classes of catchments that can be unequivocally distinguished by their hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics.

	abstract = {A legacy of past forestry and grazing practices, and a century of fire suppression in semiarid forests have led to declining forest health and an increasing incidence of larger and more severe wildfires, making it imperative to rapidly reduce forest density. Changes in vegetation cover after thinning may affect water balance in forests in the Salt and Verde River watersheds of central Arizona. This planned project will analyze forest restoration treatment effects at the catchment scale on water resources from forested lands in central Arizona, as well as the broader ecologic responses of forest structure, fuels and fire behavior, and vegetation. Comprehensive water balance data collected from a 12-site paired watershed study will quantify the effects of various restoration treatments and the efficacy of prescribed burning for maintaining postrestoration water yields. Results from the paired watershed study will be used to develop, parametrize, and verify hydrologic models in order to scale up predictions to the catchment scale. Products from this project will assist downstream water managers in forecasting and planning for water availability and sedimentation, and will be key components in the adaptive-management process being implemented for the Four Forest Restoration Initiative.},

Four contrasting methods for estimating mean ﬂow, proportion of ﬂow in February, 7-day mean annual low ﬂow, mean annual high ﬂow, the all-time ﬂow duration curve and the February ﬂow duration curve at ungauged sites across New Zealand were compared. The four methods comprised: (1) an uncalibrated national-coverage physically-based rainfall-runoff model ({TopNet}); (2) data-driven empirical approaches informed by hydrological theory (Hydrology of Ungauged Catchments); (3) a purely empirically-based machine learning regression model (Random Forests); and (4) correction of the {TopNet} estimates using ﬂow duration curves estimated using Random Forests. Model performance was assessed through comparison with observed data from 485 gauging stations located across New Zealand. Three model performance metrics were calculated: Nash–Sutcliffe Efﬁciency, a normalised error index statistic (the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data) and the percentage bias. Results showed that considerable gains in {TopNet} model performance could be made when {TopNet} time-series were corrected using ﬂow duration curves estimated from Random Forests. This improvement in {TopNet} performance occurred regardless of two different parameterisations of the {TopNet} model. The Random Forests method provided the best estimates of the ﬂow duration curves and all hydrological indices except mean ﬂow. Mean ﬂow was best estimated using the already published Hydrology of Ungauged Catchments method.},

However, most environmental-flows management focuses on water infrastructure, such as dams or diversions, without explicitly taking groundwater into account and ignoring the importance of groundwater environmental flow contribution. In this study two methods for estimating groundwater environmental flow contributions are presented: (a) a groundwater-centric method (based on the Sustainability Boundary Approach), which proposes that high levels of ecological protection are maintained if 90\% of groundwater discharge is preserved, and (b) a surface water-centric method (novel method), which quantifies groundwater environmental flow contributions from streamflow using region-specific streamflow sensitivity metrics and local environmental-flows policies. The two methods were tested in British Columbia, Canada, which has a diverse, complex, and highly coupled groundwater-surface water system. The two methods gave comparable results in various hydro-geoclimatic settings. Although British Columbia was used as a case study, this framework can be implemented across various spatial and temporal scales for different regions and globally, in data-scarce, hydrologically complex landscapes. Application of these methods can aid in a robust and holistic assessment of environmental-flows, taking into account the often-missing groundwater component.},

While forest-snow-water relations have been well studied in areas with stable seasonal snowpacks, less is known about these interactions in the growing number of areas with ephemeral snowpacks. Here, we evaluate how forest cover and climate variability regulate the seasonality of water inputs, soil moisture, root zone water stress, and percolation at two contrasting seasonal vs. ephemeral snowpack sites, in Arizona, {USA}. We use a soil moisture model (Hydrus-1D) and three years of continuous soil moisture measurements at two depths (0-10 cm and 0-30 cm) for 6 locations/site distributed across gradients of forest cover. Each soil moisture measurement location has a unique daily moisture input time series previously developed from local snow/rain observations and modeling. Compared to the seasonal snowpack site, the ephemeral site has wetter soils during winters due to frequent mid-winter melt events, leading to greater annual percolation. However, earlier snowmelt at the ephemeral snowpack site also prolongs the duration of root zone water stress. At both sites, dense forest cover is associated with less percolation and longer duration of soil drought, due to increased transpiration. These effects are amplified during an abnormally dry winter. This study examines two sites over three years and develops key steps towards using spatially distributed snowpack and soil moisture measurements to assess how changing climate and forest cover jointly regulate water availability for future ecosystems and downstream use.},

	abstract = {Humans have exerted large-scale changes on the terrestrial biosphere, primarily through agriculture; however, the impacts of such changes on the hydrologic cycle are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the conversion of natural rangeland ecosystems to agricultural ecosystems impacts the subsurface portion of the hydrologic cycle by changing groundwater recharge and ﬂushing salts to underlying aquifers. The hypothesis was examined through point and areal studies investigating the effects of land use/land cover ({LU}/{LC}) changes on groundwater recharge and solute transport in the Amargosa Desert ({AD}) in Nevada and in the High Plains ({HP}) in Texas, {US}. Studies use the fact that matric (pore-water-pressure) potential and environmental-tracer proﬁles in thick unsaturated zones archive past changes in recharging ﬂuxes. Results show that recharge is related to {LU}/{LC} as follows: discharge through evapotranspiration (i.e., no recharge; upward ﬂuxes o0.1 mm {yrÀ}1) in natural rangeland ecosystems (low matric potentials; high chloride and nitrate concentrations); moderate-to-high recharge in irrigated agricultural ecosystems (high matric potentials; lowto-moderate chloride and nitrate concentrations) ({AD} recharge: \$ 130–640 mm {yrÀ}1); and moderate recharge in nonirrigated (dryland) agricultural ecosystems (high matric potentials; low chloride and nitrate concentrations, and increasing groundwater levels) ({HP} recharge: \$ 9–32 mm {yrÀ}1). Replacement of rangeland with agriculture changed ﬂow directions from upward (discharge) to downward (recharge). Recent replacement of rangeland with irrigated ecosystems was documented through downward displacement of chloride and nitrate fronts. Thick unsaturated zones contain a reservoir of salts that are readily mobilized under increased recharge related to {LU}/{LC} changes, potentially degrading groundwater quality. Sustainable land use requires quantitative knowledge of the linkages between ecosystem change, recharge, and groundwater quality.},

	abstract = {This study presents new data-driven, annual estimates of the division of precipitation into the recharge, quick-ﬂow runoff, and evapotranspiration ({ET}) water budget components for 2000-2013 for the contiguous United States ({CONUS}). The algorithms used to produce these maps ensure water budget consistency over this broad spatial scale, with contributions from precipitation inﬂux attributed to each component at 800 m resolution. The quick-ﬂow runoff estimates for the contribution to the rapidly varying portion of the hydrograph are produced using data from 1,434 gaged watersheds, and depend on precipitation, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, and surﬁcial geology type. Evapotranspiration estimates are produced from a regression using water balance data from 679 gaged watersheds and depend on land cover, temperature, and precipitation. The quick-ﬂow and {ET} estimates are combined to calculate recharge as the remainder of precipitation. The {ET} and recharge estimates are checked against independent ﬁeld data, and the results show good agreement. Comparisons of recharge estimates with groundwater extraction data show that in 15\% of the country, groundwater is being extracted at rates higher than the local recharge. These maps of the internally consistent water budget components of recharge, quick-ﬂow runoff, and {ET}, being derived from and tested against data, are expected to provide reliable ﬁrst-order estimates of these quantities across the {CONUS}, even where ﬁeld measurements are sparse.},

Mean annual groundwater recharge for the 2000–2017 study period estimated by area-weighting annual baseflow was found to be approximately 220 mm but vary widely from 73 to 467 mm based on precipitation inputs. Recharge was found to be particularly concentrated in the months of March to July which accounted for 66\% of the average annual recharge. Baseflow discharged from the drought-impacted headwater basins was highly correlated to U.S. Drought Monitor designations in Iowa headwater basins and thresholds varied among landscape regions due to differences in soils and hydrology. Economic losses due to drought were found to substantially increase when annual groundwater recharge was less than approximately 130 mm yr−1. Overall, study results suggest that regional groundwater recharge and drought susceptibility can be reliably assessed using baseflow available from networked stream gages.},

Groundwater is of strategic importance. The accurate estimation of groundwater recharge and assessing the fundamental controlling factors are therefore of utmost importance to protect groundwater systems. We used the spatially-distributed water-balance model {WetSpass} to estimate long-term average recharge in Flanders. We validated recharge rates with base flow estimates of 67 daily stream flow records using the hydrograph analyses. To this end we performed principal component analysis, multiple linear regression analysis and relative importance analysis to assess the controlling factors of the spatial variation of recharge and base flow with the influencing watershed characteristics.
New hydrological insights for the region
The average resulting recharge is 235mm/year and occurs mainly in winter. The overall moderate correlation between base flow estimates and modeled recharge rates indicates that base flow is a reasonable proxy of recharge. Groundwater recharge variation was explained in order of importance by precipitation, soil texture and vegetation cover; while base flow variation was strongly controlled by vegetation cover and groundwater depth. The results of this study highlight the important role of spatial variables in estimation of recharge and base flow. In addition, the prominent role of vegetation makes clear the potential importance of land-use changes on recharge and hence the need to include a proper strategy for land-use change in sustainable management of groundwater resources.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Population growth is increasing the pressure on water resource availability. For useful assessment and planning for societal water availability impacts, it is imperative to disentangle the direct influences of human activities in the landscape from external climate‐driven influences on water flows and their variation and change. In this study we used the water balance model, a gridded global hydrological model, to quantify and distinguish human‐driven change components, modified by interventions such as dams, reservoirs, and water withdrawals for irrigation, industry, and households, from climate‐driven change components on four key water balance variables in the terrestrial hydrological system (evapotranspiration, runoff, soil moisture, storage change). We also analyzed emergent effect patterns in and across different parts of the world, facilitating exploration of spatial variability and regional patterns on multiple spatial scales, from pixel to global, including previously uninvestigated parts of the world. Our results show that human activities drive changes in all hydrological variables, with different magnitudes and directions depending on geographical location. The differences between model scenarios with and without human activities were largest in regions with the highest population densities. In such regions, which also have relatively large numbers of dams for irrigation, water largely tends to be removed from storage and go to feed increased runoff and evapotranspiration fluxes. Our analysis considers a more complete set of hydrological variables than previous studies and can guide further research and management planning for future hydrological and water availability trends, including in relatively data‐poor parts of the world.
          , 
            Plain Language Summary
            The global population is growing, increasing demands for water use. Knowledge of how human activities affect water resources is available for some areas and water cycle components, but more data are needed for solid scientific understanding of climate and human‐driven effects on water resources in the past and present, and to underpin management approaches to future trends in hydrology and water availability. This study examined human activity effects on different components of the terrestrial water cycle, distinct from the effects of climate change. Results showed that human activities alter movements of water worldwide, with changes, magnitudes, and directions depending on world region. The greatest human‐driven changes emerged in regions with the highest population density, which also have relatively large numbers of dams providing water for agricultural use. Overall, the water changes in these regions tend to include water removal from storage going to feed increased evapotranspiration and/or runoff. Regions with such change trends will require solutions to overcome future negative impacts on society and ecosystems. This study showed how different water cycle components and land regions have been affected by changes in human activities, and findings can guide research and management planning for hydrological and water availability in future years.

In this study, we combine information provided by available {ET} data and equations to produce a new monthly data set for {ET} for the conterminous U.S. ({CONUS}). These maps are produced from 1895 to 2018 at an 800 m spatial scale, marking a finer resolution than currently available products over this time period. In our approach, the relative performance of a suite of {ET} equations is assessed using water balance, flux tower, and remotely sensed {ET} estimates. At the observation locations, we use error distributions to quantify relative weights for the equations and use these in a modified Bayesian model averaging weighted ensemble approach. The relative weights are spatially generalized using a random forest regression, which is applied to wall-to-wall explanatory variable maps to generate {CONUS}-wide relative weight maps and ensemble estimates. We assess the performance of the ensemble using a reserved subset of the observations and compare this performance against other national-scale map products for historical to modern {ET}. The ensemble {ET} maps are shown to provide an improved accuracy over the alternative comparison products. These {ET} maps could be useful for a variety of hydrologic modeling and assessment applications that benefit from a long record, such as the study of periods of water scarcity through time.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Naturally occurring long‐term mean annual base recharge to ground water in Nebraska was estimated with the help of a water‐balance approach and an objective automated technique for base‐flow separation involving minimal parameter‐optimization requirements. Base recharge is equal to total recharge minus the amount of evapotranspiration coming directly from ground water. The estimation of evapotranspiration in the water‐balance equation avoids the need to specify a contributing drainage area for ground water, which in certain cases may be considerably different from the drainage area for surface runoff. Evapotranspiration was calculated by the {WREVAP} model at the Solar and Meteorological Surface Observation Network ({SAMSON}) sites. Long‐term mean annual base recharge was derived by determining the product of estimated long‐term mean annual runoff (the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration) and the base‐flow index ({BFI}). The {BFI} was calculated from discharge data obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey's gauging stations in Nebraska. Mapping was achieved by using geographic information systems ({GIS}) and geostatistics. This approach is best suited for regional‐scale applications. It does not require complex hydrogeologic modeling nor detailed knowledge of soil characteristics, vegetation cover, or land‐use practices. Long‐term mean annual base recharge rates in excess of 110 mm/year resulted in the extreme eastern part of Nebraska. The western portion of the state expressed rates of only 15 to 20 mm annually, while the Sandhills region of north‐central Nebraska was estimated to receive twice as much base recharge (40 to 50 mm/year) as areas south of it.},

	abstract = {Depth-to-water measurements from 181 monitoring wells in unconﬁned or semi-conﬁned aquifers in nine regions of the central and northeastern U.S. were analyzed. Groundwater storage exhibited strong seasonal variations in all regions, with peaks in spring and lows in autumn, and its interannual variability was nearly unbounded, such that the impacts of droughts, ﬂoods, and excessive pumping could persist for many years. We found that the spatial variability of groundwater storage anomalies (deviations from the long term mean) increases as a power function of extent scale (square root of area). That relationship, which is linear on a log–log graph, is common to other hydrological variables but had never before been shown with groundwater data. We describe how the derived power function can be used to determine the number of wells needed to estimate regional mean groundwater storage anomalies with a desired level of accuracy, or to assess uncertainty in regional mean estimates from a set number of observations. We found that the spatial variability of groundwater storage anomalies within a region often increases with the absolute value of the regional mean anomaly, the opposite of the relationship between soil moisture spatial variability and mean. Recharge (drainage from the lowest model soil layer) simulated by the Variable Inﬁltration Capacity ({VIC}) model was compatible with observed monthly groundwater storage anomalies and month-to-month changes in groundwater storage.},

This paper comprehensively evaluates four widely used non-tracer baseﬂow separation methods against tracer-based hydrograph separation for ﬁve Eastern Australian catchments. The four methods include United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology ({UKIH}) method and three digital ﬁltering methods: Lyne–Hollick method, Chapman–Maxwell method and Eckhardt method. The ﬁrst two ﬁltering methods include a parameter of recession constant, and the last one has two parameters: the recession constant and the maximum baseﬂow index. We used an Automatic Baseﬂow Identiﬁcation Technique ({ABIT}) to estimate the recession constant, which varies from 0.943 to 0.987 for the ﬁve catchments that is evidently higher than the default value of 0.925, and used the default Eckhardt and {UKIH} methods to estimate the maximum baseﬂow index, respectively. All modelling results are evaluated against the tracer-based hydrograph separation. Using the recession constant estimated from the {ABIT} method performs noticeably better than using the default parameter, indicated by the absolute bias reduced about 20\% in average. For the two-parameter Eckhardt method, estimating the maximum baseﬂow index has larger effect on baseﬂow separation than estimating the recession constant. Compared to the different parameterisation schemes, the difference among the improved nontracer methods is small. Using multiple passes into the Lyne–Hollick method can only slightly improve or deteriorate baseﬂow index estimates. Our results suggest that it is critical to get appropriate parameter(s) before applying the digital ﬁltering methods.},

The investigation used a wide range of hydrogeological techniques including geological mapping, surface and borehole geophysics, groundwater hydraulics, streambed temperature and pressure monitoring, and hydrogeochemical and environmental tracer sampling, and it was complemented by analysis of rainfall intensity from 18 tipping-bucked rain gauges, climate data and stream runoff measurements. Run-off and recharge from a 200-mm rainfall event in January 2015, the largest daily rainfall in the local 50-year record, were investigated in detail. While this major storm provided substantial run-off as a potential source for focused, indirect recharge, it only produced enough actual recharge to the shallow aquifer to temporarily halt a long-term groundwater recession. A series of smaller rainfallrunoff events in 2016 produced a similar recharge response. The results suggest that the total magnitude of a flood event is not the main control on indirect groundwater recharge at this location. A deeper aquifer shows no hydraulic response to surface-water flow events and is isolated from the shallow system, consistent with its Pleistocene groundwater age. This supports a growing body of evidence indicating that attributing or predicting generalised changes in recharge to changes in climate in dryland environments should not be attempted without first unravelling the dynamic processes governing groundwater recharge in the locality of interest. The results should prompt more detailed and long-term field investigation in other arid zone locations to further understand the episodic and nonlinear nature of recharge in such environments.},

            A warmer climate increases evaporative demand. However, response to warming depends on water availability. Existing earth system models represent soil moisture but simplify groundwater connections, a primary control on soil moisture. Here we apply an integrated surface-groundwater hydrologic model to evaluate the sensitivity of shallow groundwater to warming across the majority of the {US}. We show that as warming shifts the balance between water supply and demand, shallow groundwater storage can buffer plant water stress; but only where shallow groundwater connections are present, and not indefinitely. As warming persists, storage can be depleted and connections lost. Similarly, in the arid western {US} warming does not result in significant groundwater changes because this area is already largely water limited. The direct response of shallow groundwater storage to warming demonstrates the strong and early effect that low to moderate warming may have on groundwater storage and evapotranspiration.},

The characteristic drainage timescale parameter (K) of the linear response function was chosen as the effectiveness measure of the automated method; the K values estimated using this method are 44.5 Æ 13.2 days compared with 45.7 Æ 10.5 days estimated manually for the catchments with long records. The effects of different imposed criteria on the base flow selection are also quantified using this parameter.

	abstract = {To achieve water resource sustainability in the water-limited southwestern {US}, it is critical to understand the potential effects of proposed forest thinning on the hydrology of semi-arid basins, where disturbances to headwater catchments can cause significant changes in the local water balance components and basinwise streamflows. In Arizona, the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) is being developed with the goal of restoring 2.4 million acres of ponderosa pine along the Mogollon Rim. Using the physically based, spatially distributed triangulated irregular network ({TIN})-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator ({tRIBS}) model, we examine the potential impacts of the 4FRI on the hydrology of Tonto Creek, a basin in the Verde–Tonto–Salt ({VTS}) system, which provides much of the water supply for the Phoenix metropolitan area. Long-term (20-year) simulations indicate that forest removal can trigger significant shifts in the spatiotemporal patterns of various hydrological components, causing increases in net radiation, surface temperature, wind speed, soil evaporation, groundwater recharge and runoff, at the expense of reductions in interception and shading, transpiration, vadose zone moisture and snow water equivalent, with south-facing slopes being more susceptible to enhanced atmospheric losses. The net effect will likely be increases in mean and maximum streamflow, particularly during El Niño events and the winter months, and chiefly for those scenarios in which soil hydraulic conductivity has been significantly reduced due to thinning operations. In this particular climate, forest thinning can lead to net loss of surface water storage by vegetation and snowpack, increasing the vulnerability of ecosystems and populations to larger and more frequent hydrologic extreme conditions on these semi-arid systems.},

	doi = {10.5194/hess-13-2055-2009},
	abstract = {Assessment of water resources available in different storages and moving along different pathways in a catchment is important for its optimal use and protection, and also for the prediction of floods and low flows. Moreover, understanding of the runoff generation processes is essential for assessing the impacts of climate and land use changes on the hydrological response of a catchment. Many methods for base flow separation exist, but hardly one focuses on the specific behaviour of temperate lowland areas. This paper presents the results of a base flow separation study carried out in a lowland area in the Netherlands. In this study, field observations of precipitation, groundwater and surface water levels and discharges, together with tracer analysis are used to understand the runoff generation processes in the catchment. Several tracer and non-tracer based base flow separation methods were applied to the discharge time series, and their results are compared. 

 The results show that groundwater levels react fast to precipitation events in this lowland area with shallow groundwater tables. Moreover, a good correlation was found between groundwater levels and discharges suggesting that most of the measured discharge also during floods comes from groundwater storage. It was estimated using tracer hydrological approaches that approximately 90\% of the total discharge is groundwater displaced by event water mainly infiltrating in the northern part of the catchment, and only the remaining 10\% is surface runoff. The impact of remote recharge causing displacement of near channel groundwater during floods could also be motivated with hydraulic approximations. The results show further that when base flow separation is meant to identify groundwater contributions to stream flow, process based methods (e.g. the rating curve method; Kliner and Knezek, 1974) are more reliable than other simple non-tracer based methods. Also, the recursive filtering method (proposed by Eckhardt, 2005) can be calibrated well using the results of tracer investigation giving good results. Consequently, non-tracer based base flow separation methods that can be validated for some events may provide a powerful tool for groundwater assessment or model calibration/validation in lowland areas.},

Understanding baseflow processes is critical to issues of water quality, supply, and habitat. This review synthesizes the body of global literature investigating relationships between baseflow and watershed characteristics of geomorphology, soil, and land use, as well as the potential effects of climate change, with an emphasis on humid, tropical and temperate (non-snowpackdominated) regions. Such factors are key controls on baseflow through their influence on infiltration, rates of water removal from the catchment, and subsurface storage properties. The literature shows that there is much that remains to be resolved in gaining a solid understanding of the influence of watershed characteristics on baseflow. While it is clear that watershed geomorphology influences baseflow, there is no consensus on which geomorphic parameters are most closely linked to subsurface storage and baseflow. Many studies associate higher watershed forest cover with lower baseflows, attributed to high evapotranspiration rates of forests, while other studies indicate increased baseflow with higher watershed forest cover due to higher infiltration and recharge of subsurface storage. The demonstrated effects of agriculture and urbanization are also inconsistent, due to varied additions of imported water and extremely variable background conditions. This review underscores the need for more research that addresses multiple aspects of the watershed system in explaining baseflows, and for methodological consistency to allow for more fruitful comparisons across case studies. These needs are of immediate demand, given scientific and management emphasis on environmental flows required for maintenance of key ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Crop evapotranspiration estimation is critical for sustainable water management under the semiarid and arid climate in New Mexico. While irrigation scheduling is based on daily evapotranspiration through the two step approach, reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficients should be determined with accuracy. The utilization of grass reference evapotranspiration ({ETo}) or alfalfa reference evapotranspiration ({ETr}) and the conversion from one to the other calls for an understanding of the relationship between {ETr} and {ETo}. The objectives of this study were to develop the ratio of {ETr} to {ETo} values (Kr) and to determine the variability of Kr during the year for six locations across the State of New Mexico ({USA}). The results showed long term annual Kr values to vary from 1.28 to 1.45 and the coefficient of determination varied from 0.96 to 0.98. Kr value decreases from January to July and increases from August to December and was at its lowest Kr value at the peak daily reference evapotranspiration. Annual average Kr values were 1.31, 1.38, 1.43, 1.38, 1.38 and 1.48 at Alcalde, Fabian Garcia, Farmington, Leyendecker, Las Cruces and Tucumcari locations and the growing season average Kr values were 1.24, 1.32, 1.38, 1.31, 1.32 and 1.42 at the respective locations. The strong correlation between {ETr} and {ETo} allows the conversion of the grass reference evapotranspiration to alfalfa reference evapotranspiration and vice versa however, caution should be taken when using the crop coefficient values to convert either {ETo} or {ETr} to actual crop evapotranspiration for irrigation scheduling and water management.},

	volume = {72},
	abstract = {The geomorphic effectiveness of extreme floods increases with aridity and decreasing watershed size. Therefore, in small dry watersheds extreme floods should control the age structure and spatial distribution of populations of disturbance-dependent riparian trees. We examined the influence of extreme floods on the bottomland morphology and forest of ephemeral streams in a semiarid region. Along six stream reaches on the Colorado Piedmont we examined channel changes by analyzing a rectified sequence of aerial photographs spanning 56 yr, and we investigated the spatial distribution of different-aged patches of forest by aging 189 randomly sampled cottonwood trees. Channel change in these ephemeral sand-bed streams is dominated by widening, which occurs over a span of hours during infrequent floods, and postflood narrowing, which occurs over decades between floods. Narrowing is accelerated where reliable moisture increases the density and growth rate of vegetation on the former bed. Reproduction of cottonwood trees has occurred mostly in former channel bed during periods of channel narrowing beginning after floods in 1935 and 1965 and continuing for as long as two decades. Thus cottonwood establishment is related to low flows at the time scale of a year, but to high flows at the time scale of decades. At sites that have not experienced major floods in the last 80 yr, little channel change has occurred, cottonwood reproduction has been limited, tree density has declined, and succession to grassland is occurring. Because channel change and tree reproduction in this region are driven by infrequent local events, channel width and tree age distributions vary greatly over time and among sites. For the same reason, riparian forests along these ephemeral streams can be as wide as forests along perennial rivers with much higher mean discharge.},

Groundwater is a fundamental water resource in New Zealand for agricultural, industrial and domestic use. Detailed knowledge regarding groundwater recharge potential is a pre-requisite for sustainable groundwater management, including the assessment of its vulnerability to contamination by pollutants. In this study, a comprehensive {GIS} approach was used to map the potential groundwater recharge zones across New Zealand. National data sets of lithology, slope, aspect, land use, soil drainage and drainage density were converted to raster data sets with a spatial resolution of 500 m Â 500 m and superimposed to derive groundwater potential zones. The resultant maps demonstrate that the potential is low in urban and mountainous areas, such as the Southern Alps, whereas the highest potential can be found in regions with large lakes and in the lower elevation plains areas, where Quaternary sediments prevail. The resulting maps can be used to identify areas of high nutrient leaching in zones where high groundwater recharge potential exists.},

While cool season precipitation explains most of the variability in annual ﬂows, temperature appears to be highly inﬂuential under certain conditions, with the role of antecedent fall soil moisture less clear. In both wet and dry years, when ﬂow is substantially different than expected given precipitation, these factors can modulate the dominant precipitation inﬂuence on streamﬂow. Different combinations of temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture can result in ﬂow deﬁcits of similar magnitude, but recent droughts have been ampliﬁed by warmer temperatures that exacerbate the effects of relatively modest precipitation deﬁcits. Since 1988, a marked increase in the frequency of warm years with lower ﬂows than expected, given precipitation, suggests continued warming temperatures will be an increasingly important inﬂuence in reducing future {UCRB} water supplies.},

As a rule, therefore, evapotranspiration is the largest component of the water balance equation; the other components are generally quite small (nevertheless, they may be exceedingly important). In addition, both the magnitude and the deﬁnition of the different water balance components, particularly runoff, are very much scale-dependent.},

	abstract = {Understanding and managing groundwater resources in drylands is a challenging task, but one that is globally important. The dominant process for dryland groundwater recharge is thought to be as focused, indirect recharge from ephemeral stream losses. However, there is a global paucity of data for understanding and quantifying this process and transferable techniques for quantifying groundwater recharge in such contexts are lacking. Here we develop a generalized conceptual model for understanding water table and groundwater head ﬂuctuations due to recharge from episodic events within ephemeral streams. By accounting for the recession characteristics of a groundwater hydrograph, we present a simple but powerful new water table ﬂuctuation approach to quantify focused, indirect recharge over both long term and event time scales. The technique is demonstrated using a new, and globally unparalleled, set of groundwater observations from an ephemeral stream catchment located in {NSW}, Australia. We ﬁnd that, following episodic streamﬂow events down a predominantly dry channel system, groundwater head ﬂuctuations are controlled by pressure redistribution operating at three time scales from vertical ﬂow (days to weeks), transverse ﬂow perpendicular to the stream (weeks to months), and longitudinal ﬂow parallel to the stream (years to decades). In relative terms, indirect recharge decreases almost linearly away from the mountain front, both in discrete monitored events as well as in the longterm average. In absolute terms, the estimated indirect recharge varies from 80 to 30 mm/a with the main uncertainty in these values stemming from uncertainty in the catchment-scale hydraulic properties.},

	abstract = {Significant variations in interannual and decadal recharge rates are likely in alluvial basins of the semiarid southwestern United States on the basis of decadal variations in climate and precipitation and correlation of El Niño with high rates of winter precipitation and streamflow. A better understanding of the magnitude of recharge variations in semiarid and arid regions would reduce water budget uncertainty. Variability of ephemeral channel recharge with climate in southeastern Arizona was investigated through analysis of hydrologic monitoring near three ephemeral streams in southeastern Arizona during the middle to late 1990s and by relating the results to long‐term hydrologic and climatic trends. The analysis used precipitation, streamflow, water levels in wells, estimates of groundwater storage change from repeat gravity surveys, and two climatic indicators of El Niño–Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}), Southern Oscillation index, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation ({PDO}). Results indicate that variations in winter recharge are related to {ENSO}. El Niño conditions correspond with a greater probability of high rates of winter precipitation, streamflow, and recharge. La Niña conditions are almost exclusively associated with below‐average recharge. Rates of recharge along Rillito Creek near Tucson during 1977–1998, a period of frequent El Niño conditions and positive {PDO} values, were 3 times recharge rates during 1941–1957, a period dominated by La Niña conditions and low {PDO} values. Quantification of recharge variability with decadal climate cycles should improve estimates of rates of aquifer drainage and replenishment in the region. Similar methods are applicable to other regions where thick unsaturated zones can accept significant periodic recharge.},

	abstract = {Global synthesis of the ﬁndings from ¾140 recharge study areas in semiarid and arid regions provides important information on recharge rates, controls, and processes, which are critical for sustainable water development. Water resource evaluation, dryland salinity assessment (Australia), and radioactive waste disposal ({US}) are among the primary goals of many of these recharge studies. The chloride mass balance ({CMB}) technique is widely used to estimate recharge. Average recharge rates estimated over large areas (40–374 000 km2) range from 0Ð2 to 35 mm year 1, representing 0Ð1–5\% of long-term average annual precipitation. Extreme local variability in recharge, with rates up to ¾720 m year 1, results from focussed recharge beneath ephemeral streams and lakes and preferential ﬂow mostly in fractured systems. System response to climate variability and land use/land cover ({LU}/{LC}) changes is archived in unsaturated zone tracer proﬁles and in groundwater level ﬂuctuations. Inter-annual climate variability related to El Nin˜o Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) results in up to three times higher recharge in regions within the {SW} {US} during periods of frequent El Nin˜os (1977–1998) relative to periods dominated by La Nin˜as (1941–1957). Enhanced recharge related to {ENSO} is also documented in Argentina. Climate variability at decadal to century scales recorded in chloride proﬁles in Africa results in recharge rates of 30 mm year 1 during the Sahel drought (1970–1986) to 150 mm year 1 during non-drought periods. Variations in climate at millennial scales in the {SW} {US} changed systems from recharge during the Pleistocene glacial period (½10 000 years ago) to discharge during the Holocene semiarid period. {LU}/{LC} changes such as deforestation in Australia increased recharge up to about 2 orders of magnitude. Changes from natural grassland and shrublands to dryland (rain-fed) agriculture altered systems from discharge (evapotranspiration, {ET}) to recharge in the {SW} {US}. The impact of {LU} change was much greater than climate variability in Niger (Africa), where replacement of savanna by crops increased recharge by about an order of magnitude even during severe droughts. Sensitivity of recharge to {LU}/{LC} changes suggests that recharge may be controlled through management of {LU}. In irrigated areas, recharge varies from 10 to 485 mm year 1, representing 1–25\% of irrigation plus precipitation. However, irrigation pumpage in groundwater-fed irrigated areas greatly exceeds recharge rates, resulting in groundwater mining. Increased recharge related to cultivation has mobilized salts that accumulated in the unsaturated zone over millennia, resulting in widespread groundwater and surface water contamination, particularly in Australia. The synthesis of recharge rates provided in this study contains valuable information for developing sustainable groundwater resource programmes within the context of climate variability and {LU}/{LC} change.

Characterization of the water supply for {GRCA} was improved through multiyear hydrograph analyses at five springs discharging from the Redwall-Muav (R) aquifer: Roaring Springs, Emmett Spring, At Last Spring, Tapeats Spring, and Abyss River Spring. Comparison of snowmelt response timing and mean recession coefficients among the five springs show no significant differences, indicating similar timing of snowmelt-related discharge and flow regimes across 50 km of horizontal and 1,000 m of vertical distance through the aquifer system. The mean water volumes discharged during snowmelt and the mean annual discharge are significantly different between Roaring Springs, Emmett Spring, Tapeats Spring, and Abyss River Spring. Linear regression analyses indicate no annual trends in any of the evaluated aquifer characteristics for any spring, except for more stable baseflow between recessions at Tapeats Spring. Water budgets calculated for Roaring Springs are imbalanced, suggesting missing outflow components, a need to refine the recharge region through dye trace studies, and inaccurate precipitation and evapotranspiration data, requiring model improvement. Continued hydrograph comparisons, trend analyses, and water budgets for additional years and springs will be useful for future groundwater modeling and for forecasting impacts on the R aquifer.},

Base ﬂow availability varies over space and time in a region due to climate, topography, landscape, and geological characteristics. In this study, base ﬂow index ({BFI}) (base ﬂow/total stream ﬂow) was estimated from daily streamﬂow records using a recursive digital ﬁlter method and interpolated to produce a raster grid map for the conterminous United States. When compared for validation, {BFI} estimated by recursive digital ﬁlter method showed good agreement overall with the {USGS} smoothed minima {BFI} method. Estimated base ﬂow index and volume were analyzed, with Hydrological Landscape Regions ({HLRs}) developed for the United States to identify the mean hydrologic ﬂow response within {HLR}. They were also used to determine relationships with hydro-geologic descriptive variables and used for deﬁning the {HLRs} based on Pearson’s correlation table and a stepwise multiple regression. These descriptive variables used in deﬁning the {HLRs} include relief, effective rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and percentage of sand. The regression results indicated that relief and percentage of sand were highly correlated to base ﬂow index, and the amount of base ﬂow volume can be related to gradient and the amount of effective rainfall. The regression results also suggested that the descriptive variables used in constructing the {HLR} can be used to deﬁne mean values of shallow ground water ﬂow within the regions. Further testing is needed to ascertain if such relationships could be used to deﬁne ﬂow within an {HLR}.},

	abstract = {Linear regression methods can be used to quantify geological controls on baseﬂow index ({BFI}). This is illustrated using an example from the Thames Basin, {UK}. Two approaches have been adopted. The areal extents of geological classes based on lithostratigraphic and hydrogeological classiﬁcation schemes have been correlated with {BFI} for 44 ‘natural’ catchments from the Thames Basin. When regression models are built using lithostratigraphic classes that include a constant term then the model is shown to have some physical meaning and the relative inﬂuence of the different geological classes on {BFI} can be quantiﬁed. For example, the regression constants for two such models, 0.64 and 0.69, are consistent with the mean observed {BFI} (0.65) for the Thames Basin, and the signs and relative magnitudes of the regression coefﬁcients for each of the lithostratigraphic classes are consistent with the hydrogeology of the Basin. In addition, regression coefﬁcients for the lithostratigraphic classes scale linearly with estimates of log10 hydraulic conductivity for each lithological class. When a regression is built using a hydrogeological classiﬁcation scheme with no constant term, the model does not have any physical meaning, but it has a relatively high adjusted R2 value and because of the continuous coverage of the hydrogeological classiﬁcation scheme, the model can be used for predictive purposes. A model calibrated on the 44 ‘natural’ catchments and using four hydrogeological classes (low-permeability surﬁcial deposits, consolidated aquitards, fractured aquifers and intergranular aquifers) is shown to perform as well as a model based on a hydrology of soil types ({BFIHOST}) scheme in predicting {BFI} in the Thames Basin. Validation of this model using 110 other ‘variably impacted’ catchments in the Basin shows that there is a correlation between modelled and observed {BFI}. Where the observed {BFI} is signiﬁcantly higher than modelled {BFI} the deviations can be explained by an exogenous factor, catchment urban area. It is inferred that this is may be due inﬂuences from sewage discharge, mains leakage, and leakage from septic tanks.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean region is a climate change hotspot where the rate of climate change exceeds the global mean. The rapidly changing climate in combination with an increase in anthropogenic pressures cause water resources in the Mediterranean basin to become increasingly scarce. Modelling future water resource availability considering both climate and anthropogenic changes on karst catchments remains a major challenge in the field of hydrology. The purpose of this study is to assess the relative effects of climate change and anthropogenic forcing on the spring discharge of a Mediterranean karst system by coupling 12 climate model simulations under two emission scenarios ({RCP} 4.5 and {RCP} 8.5) with three hydrological models and four scenarios of future groundwater extraction for drinking water supply (no abstraction, present-day abstraction, +50\% abstraction and + 100\% abstraction at horizon 2100). The study area is the Oeillal spring’s karst catchment which is located at the Fonfroide-Monredon massif located in Southern France. The periods of spring drying-up can increase up to 30\% according the {RCP} 4.5 and up to 70\% according the {RCP} 8.5. This may be aggravated by groundwater abstraction in the area which, combined with climate change, could contribute to double the length of spring drying-up period in the worst scenario. The main results of the study suggest that climate change has a major effect on the future evolution of the Oeillal spring’s discharge and that groundwater abstraction constitutes a secondary but non-negligible factor which increases the occurrence of drying-up of this Mediterranean spring.},

A distributed-parameter water-balance model (the Basin Characterization Model, or {BCM}) was used in the analysis. Data requirements of the {BCM} included digital representations of topography, soils, geology, and vegetation, together with monthly time-series of precipitation and airtemperature data. Time-series of potential evapotranspiration were generated by using a submodel for solar radiation, taking into account topographic shading, cloudiness, and vegetation density. Snowpack accumulation and melting were modeled using precipitation and air-temperature data. Amounts of water available for runoff and ground-water recharge were calculated on the basis of water-budget considerations by using measured- and generated-meteorologic time series together with estimates of soil-water storage and saturated hydraulic conductivity of subsoil geologic units. Calculations were made on a computational grid with a horizontal resolution of about 270 meters for the entire 1,033,840 square-kilometer study area.},

            Abstract
            Groundwater sustains food production and ecosystem health in drylands. Groundwater influences the interlinked hydrological processes and ecological state; however, the function of groundwater in the ecohydrological system is yet to be quantified clearly. In this study, we assess the role of groundwater in the ecohydrological system of the Heihe River Basin, using a regional‐scale integrated model with multiple independent databases. Our results show that first, in over 40\% of mid‐lower plain, the groundwater table is less than 10 m deep, and both recharge and evaporation of groundwater dominate seasonal water budget variations; recharge is more affected by land use than groundwater evaporation, and it has a higher variability ranging over 2 orders of magnitude within vegetated land use type. Second, mountain block recharge maintains the piedmont groundwater; the upper mountainous partition between baseflow and mountain block recharge impacts the evaporation and two‐way exchange between groundwater and stream/lake in the downstream alluvial plain. Third, the groundwater system stores over 50\% of streamflow in the dry season and about 10\% in the wet season along leakage segments; groundwater dominates the streams by contributing about 40\% of streamflow in the dry season along the seepage segments of the middle alluvial plain. Fourth, shallow groundwater sustains a vibrant ecosystem directly by providing a stable source of water for vegetation and indirectly by buffering lateral groundwater flow. Our study not only bridges the quantification gap for regional studies of drylands but also provides suggestions on water management and future water sustainability and food security.},

              Groundwater is critical for many ecosystems, yet groundwater requirements for dependent ecosystems are rarely accounted for during water and conservation planning. Here we compile 38 years of Landsat-derived normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) to evaluate groundwater-dependent vegetation responses to changes in depth to groundwater ({DTG}) across California. To maximize applicability, we standardized raw {NDVI} and {DTG} values using
              Z
              scores to identify groundwater thresholds, groundwater targets and map potential drought refugia across a diversity of biomes and local conditions. Groundwater thresholds were analysed for vegetation impacts where

Our approach provides a simple and robust methodology for water and conservation practitioners to support ecosystem water needs so biodiversity and sustainable water-management goals can be achieved.},

	abstract = {We assessed and quantified future projected changes in terrestrial evaporative demand by calculating Potential Evapotranspiration ({PET}) for the North American Monsoon region in the Southwestern U.S. and Mexico. The {PET} projections were calculated using the daily Penman–Monteith equation. The terrestrial meteorological variables needed for the equation (i.e., minimum and maximum daily temperature, specific humidity, wind speed, incoming shortwave radiation, and pressure) were obtained from the North American–{CORDEX} initiative. We used dynamically downscaled projections of three {CMIP}5 {GCMs} for {RCP}8.5 emission scenarios (i.e., {HadGEM}2-{ES}, {MPIESM}-{LR}, and {GFDL}-{ESM}2M), and each was dynamically downscaled to {\textasciitilde}25 km by two {RCMs} (i.e., {WRF} and {regCM}4). All terrestrial annual {PET} projections showed a statistically significant increase when comparing the historical period (1986–2005) to future projections (2020–2039 and 2040–2059). The regional spatial average of the six {GCM}-{RCM} combinations projected an increase in the annual {PET} of about +4\% and +8\% for 2020–2039 and 2040–2059, respectively. The projected average 20-year annual changes over the study area range for the two projection periods were +1.4\%–+8.7\% and +3\%–+14.2\%, respectively. The projected annual {PET} increase trends are consistent across the entire region and for the six {GCM}-{RCM} combinations. Higher annual changes are projected in the northeast part of the region, while smaller changes are projected along the pacific coast. The main drivers for the increase are the projected warming and increase in the vapor pressure deficit. The projected changes in {PET}, which represent the changes in the atmospheric evaporative demand, are substantial and likely to impact vegetation and the hydrometeorological regime in the area. Quantitative assessments of the projected {PET} changes provided by this study should be considered in upcoming studies to develop resilience plans and adaptation strategies for mitigating the projected future changes.},

            Despite the dire conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}) Assessment Reports in terms of global warming and its impacts on Earth’s climate, ecosystems and human society, a skepticism claiming that the projected global warming is alarmist or, at least, overestimated, still persists. Given the years passed since the future climate projections that served as basis for the {IPCC} 4th, 5th and 6th Assessment Reports were released, it is now possible to answer this fundamental question if the projected global warming has been over or underestimated. This study presents a comparison between {CMIP}3, {CMIP}5 and {CMIP}6 future temperature projections and observations. The results show that the global warming projected by all {CMIPs} and future climate scenarios here analyzed project a global warming slightly lower than the observed one. The observed warming is closer to the upper level of the projected ones, revealing that {CMIPs} future climate scenarios with higher {GHG} emissions appear to be the most realistic ones. These results show that {CMIPs} future warming projections have been slightly conservative up to 2020, which could suggest a similar cold bias in their warming projections up to the end of the current century. However, given the short future periods here analyzed, inferences about warming at longer timescales cannot be done with confidence, since the models internal variability can play a relevant role on timescales of 20 years and less.},

The results indicate that all four hydrological variables show an increase over most of the global land: annual projections of R, P, {ET}, and {SM} from {CMIP}6 increase in 72\%, 81\%, 82\%, and 66\% of the global land area, respectively, under a high emissions scenario during the period 2080–99 relative to 1970–99. We estimated the uncertainties in {CMIP}6 from different sources on an annual scale and found that model uncertainty dominates the total projected uncertainties during the twenty-first century [76\% (R), 73\% (P), 89\% ({ET}), and 95\% ({SM}) in the 2090s], and the contribution of internal variability decreases with time. The low-latitude regions have the greatest uncertainty in hydrological projections. In {CMIP}6, the uncertainty of projected changes in P contributes the most to the uncertainty of projected changes in R, with a contribution of 93\% on annual scale, followed by {ET} and {SM}. Overall, the performances of the {CMIP}5 and {CMIP}6 models are similar in terms of hydrological changes and the composition of their uncertainties.

Consequently, under a warming climate, it is unclear how forest thinning will impact snowpacks, evapotranspiration, and streamflow availability. In this study, we used a distributed hydrologic model to provide insight into the effects of warming and forest treatment on the hydrologic response of the Beaver Creek watershed (∼1,100 km2) of central Arizona. Prior to the numerical experiments, confidence in the hydrologic model performance was established by comparisons to long‐term observations (2003–2018) of snow water equivalent and streamflow using station observations and through spatially distributed estimates. Results indicated that warming during the 21st century could increase mean annual streamflow by 1.5\% for warming levels up to +1°C, followed by a 29\% decrease for continued warming up to +6°C, due to the varying effects of warming on snow sublimation, soil evaporation, and plant transpiration. On average, forest thinning increased streamflow by +12\% (or 7 mm/yr) through lower plant transpiration by 19\% (or 18 mm/yr), while also increasing the change in soil water storage by +42\% (or 11 mm/yr). Forest thinning delayed the detrimental effects of warming on streamflow until +4°C, as compared to +2°C without forest treatment. Furthermore, model results suggested that forest cover reductions laterally displace water availability and evapotranspiration to downstream sites. These model‐derived mechanisms provide insights on the potential for water resilience toward warming effects afforded through treatment projects in southwestern {US} ponderosa pine forests.},

	abstract = {Use of Managed Aquifer Recharge ({MAR}) has rapidly increased in Australia, {USA}, and Europe in recent years as an efﬁcient means of recycling stormwater or treated sewage efﬂuent for non-potable and indirect potable reuse in urban and rural areas. Yet aquifers have been relied on knowingly for water storage and unwittingly for water treatment for millennia. Hence if ‘leading edge’ is deﬁned as ‘the foremost part of a trend; a vanguard’, it would be misleading to claim managed aquifer recharge as a leading edge technology. However it has taken a signiﬁcant investment in scientiﬁc research in recent years to demonstrate the effectiveness of aquifers as sustainable treatment systems to enable managed aquifer recharge to be recognised along side engineered treatment systems in water recycling. It is a ‘cross-over’ technology that is applicable to water and wastewater treatment and makes use of passive low energy processes to spectacularly reduce the energy requirements for water supply. It is robust within limits, has low cost, is suitable from village to city scale supplies, and offers as yet almost untapped opportunities for producing safe drinking water supplies where they do not yet exist. It will have an increasingly valued role in securing water supplies to sustain cities affected by climate change and population growth. However it is not a universal panacea and relies on the presence of suitable aquifers and sources of water together with effective governance to ensure human health and environment protection and water resources planning and management. This paper describes managed aquifer recharge, illustrates its use in Australia, outlining economics, guidelines and policies, and presents some of the knowledge about aquifer treatment processes that are revealing the latent value of aquifers as urban water infrastructure and provide a driver to improving our understanding of urban hydrogeology.},

	abstract = {Managed Aquifer Recharge ({MAR}) is a promising approach to enhance water supply resilience, but it faces significant challenges, such as limited space and time for recharge activities, as well as uncertain bio-geophysical processes, and complex subsurface flow and heterogeneity. In this review, we assess the viability of hydrologybased approaches to enhance groundwater replenishment and identify missing components in existing groundwater recovery activities. We discuss expanding recharge opportunities to under-utilized sources and locations such as hillslopes and mountain systems. Additionally, we explore the possibilities of using existing road infrastructure to capture runoff and convey it to secondary porosity (alluvial fans, faults and fractures) in the mountain fronts. Conventional {MAR} approaches are usually implemented on valley floors where restrictive clay layers can impede recharge to deep aquifers, and the presence of legacy contaminants in the root or vadose zones can degrade water quality. Hillslope and mountain recharge strategies offer multiple potential benefits over valley floors when there is improved connectivity and faster recharge to deep aquifers, shallower vadose zones, coarser textured deposits, and better surface water quality. Studies show that hillslope recharge accounts for 15–50\% of the recharge to valley floors. To further facilitate the effective expansion of groundwater recharge, we propose landscape modifications encompassing slope correction and implementing biological and structural techniques to repurpose roadside channel systems to slow down and/or store flow in hillslopes. These systems can facilitate groundwater recharge and ultimately contribute to sustainable groundwater management. Innovative scientific analyses can help us understand the impacts of {MAR} on water quality and quantity, uncover the limitations and strengths of recharge in specific locations, and identify the most effective systems. Addressing these gaps will help us achieve a more resilient and sustainable groundwater future.},

            Groundwater interactions with mountain streams are often simplified in model projections, potentially leading to inaccurate estimates of streamflow response to climate change. Here, using a high-resolution, integrated hydrological model extending 400 m into the subsurface, we find groundwater an important and stable source of historical streamflow in a mountainous watershed of the Colorado River. In a warmer climate, increased forest water use is predicted to reduce groundwater recharge resulting in groundwater storage loss. Losses are expected to be most severe during dry years and cannot recover to historical levels even during simulated wet periods. Groundwater depletion substantially reduces annual streamflow with intermittent conditions predicted when precipitation is low. Expanding results across the region suggests groundwater declines will be highest in the Colorado Headwater and Gunnison basins. Our research highlights the tight coupling of vegetation and groundwater dynamics and that excluding explicit groundwater response to warming may underestimate future reductions in mountain streamflow.},

Then, bias-corrected and downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ({CMIP}5) climate data from 2035 to 2060 with eleven climate models under two different representative concentration pathways ({RCP} 2.6 and {RCP} 8.5) were fed into {SWAT} to quantify the effects of future climate. Watershed {LULC} change was represented in {SWAT} via a future projected dataset developed by the United States Geological Survey ({USGS}). Past, present, and future potential streamflow responses to {LULC} and climate changes were analyzed for various ecologically relevant flow parameters. A total of 38 key flow parameters known to have significant impacts on aquatic flora and fauna were examined including high, low, and median flows, as well as flashiness. Increased summer temperature and decreased fall precipitation are expected in the study region accompanied by rapid urbanization. Climate change is expected to increase maximum monthly streamflows, especially in June-September potentially altering habitat availability for aquatic organisms. When climate change was combined with {LULC} change, more frequent drought and flood events are expected, which may negatively affect many fish species. Significant shifts in the timing of annual extreme streamflow conditions were also predicted in the future, which may adversely impact the life cycle of various aquatic species.},

	abstract = {Flood variability associated with urbanization, ecological change, and climatic change is of increasing economic and social concern in and around Flagstaff, Arizona, where flood hydrology is influenced by a biannual precipitation regime and the relatively unique geologic setting at the edge of the San Francisco Volcanic Field on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. There has been limited long-term gauging of the ephemeral channels draining the developed lands and dry coniferous forests of the region, resulting in a spaciotemporal gap in observation-based assessments of largescale flooding patterns. We present new data from over 10 years of flood monitoring using a crest stage gauge network, combined with other channel monitoring records from multiple agency sources, to assess inter-decadal patterns of flood change in the area, with a specific emphasis on examining how various controls and disturbances have altered the character and seasonality of peak annual flows. Methods of analysis included the following: using Fisher’s Exact Test to compare the seasonality of flooding between historic data spanning the 1970s and contemporary data obtained since 2010; summarizing {GIS}-based spatial data and meteorological timeseries to characterize study catchment conditions and changes between flood study periods; and relating spatiotemporal patterns of flood seasonality and occurrences of notably large floods with catchment characteristics and environmental changes. Our results show systematic patterns and changes in Flagstaff-area flood regimes that relate to geologic and topographic controls of the varied catchment systems, and in response to records of climate variations and local catchment disturbances, including urbanization and, especially, highseverity wildfire. For most catchments there has been a shift from predominantly late winter to spring snowmelt floods, or mixed seasonal flood regimes, towards monsoon-dominated flooding, patterns which may relate to observed local warming and precipitation changes. Post-wildfire flooding has produced extreme flood discharges which have likely exceeded historical estimates of flood magnitude over decade-long monitoring periods by one to two orders of magnitude. We advocate for continued monitoring and the expansion of local stream gauge networks to enable seasonal, magnitude-frequency trend analyses, improved climate and environmental change attribution, and to better inform the many planned and ongoing flood mitigation projects being undertaken in the increasingly developed Flagstaff region.},

A simple and accurate method is essential when estimating {ET} using remote sensing data. Such a method is investigated by taking advantage of satellite measurements and the extensive ground‐based measurements available at eight enhanced surface facility sites located throughout the Southern Great Plains ({SGP}) area of the United States from January 2002 to May 2005. Data analysis shows that correlation coefficients between {ET} and surface net radiation are the highest, followed by temperatures (air temperature or land surface temperature,
              T
              
                s
              
              ), and vegetation indices (enhanced vegetation index ({EVI}) or normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI})). A simple regression equation is proposed to estimate {ET} using surface net radiation, air or land surface temperatures and vegetation indices. {ET} can be estimated using daytime‐averaged air temperature and {EVI} with a root mean square error ({RMSE}) of ∼30 W m
              −2
              and a correlation coefficient of 0.91 across all sites and years. {ET} can also be estimated with comparable accuracy using {NDVI} and
              T
              
                s
              
              . More importantly, the daytime‐averaged {ET} can also be estimated using only one measurement per day of temperatures (the daytime maximum air temperature or
              T
              
                s
              
              ) with comparable accuracy. A sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed method is only slightly sensitive to errors of temperatures, vegetation indices and net surface radiation. An independent validation was made using the measurements colleted by the eddy covariance method at six {AmeriFlux} sites throughout the United States from 2001 to 2006. The land cover associated with the {AmeriFlux} sites varies from grassland, to cropland and forest. The results show that {ET} can be reasonably predicted with a correlation coefficient that varies from 0.84 to 0.95 and a bias that varies from 3 W m
              −2
              to 15 W m
              −2
              and {RMSE} varying from ∼30 W m
              −2
              to ∼40 W m
              −2
              . The positive bias partly comes from the energy imbalance problem encountered in the eddy covariance method. The proposed method can predict {ET} under a wide range of soil moisture contents and land cover types.},

The algorithm was calibrated with five years of {ETa} data from three eddy covariance flux towers set in riparian plant associations on the upper San Pedro River, Arizona, supplemented with {ETa} data for alfalfa and cotton from the literature. The algorithm was based on an equation of the form {ETa} = {ETo} [a(1 − e−{bEVI}) − c], where the term (1 − e−{bEVI}) is derived from the Beer-Lambert Law to express light absorption by a canopy, with {EVI} replacing leaf area index as an estimate of the density of light-absorbing units. The resulting algorithm capably predicted {ETa} across riparian plants and crops (r2 = 0.73). It was then tested against water balance data for five irrigation districts and flux tower data for two riparian zones for which season-long or multi-year {ETa} data were available. Predictions were within 10\% of measured results in each case, with a non-significant (P = 0.89) difference between mean measured and modeled {ETa} of 5.4\% over all validation sites.

To better understand spatial patterns in past changes in streamﬂow, we examined relationships between watershed-scale spatial characteristics and trends in streamﬂow. Trends in streamﬂow were identiﬁed by analyzing mean daily ﬂow observations between 1940 and 2009 from 967 U.S. Geological Survey stream gages. Results indicated that streamﬂow across the continental U.S., as a whole, increased while becoming less extreme between 1940 and 2009. However, substantial departures from the continental U.S. ({CONUS}) scale pattern occurred at the regional scale, including increased annual maxima, decreased annual minima, overall drying trends, and changes in streamﬂow variability. A subset of watersheds belonging to a reference data set exhibited signiﬁcantly smaller trend magnitudes than those observed in nonreference watersheds. Boosted regression tree models were applied to examine the inﬂuence of watershed characteristics on streamﬂow trend magnitudes at both the {CONUS} and regional scale. Geographic location was found to be of particular importance at the {CONUS} scale while local variability in hydroclimate and topography tended to have a strong inﬂuence on regional-scale patterns in streamﬂow trends. This methodology facilitates detailed, data-driven analyses of how the characteristics of individual watersheds interact with largescale hydroclimate forces to inﬂuence how changes in streamﬂow manifest.},

	abstract = {Characterizing streamflow changes in the agricultural U.S. Midwest is critical for effective planning and management of water resources throughout the region. The objective of this study is to determine if and how baseflow has responded to land alteration and climate changes across the study area during the 50‐year study period by exploring hydrologic variations based on long‐term stream gage data. This study evaluates monthly contributions to annual baseflow along with possible trends over the 1966–2016 period for 458 U.S. Geological Survey streamflow gages within 12 different Midwestern states. It also examines the influence of climate and land use factors on the observed baseflow trends. Monthly contribution breakdowns demonstrate how the majority of baseflow is discharged into streams during the spring months (March, April, and May) and is overall more substantial throughout the spring (especially in April) and summer (June, July, and August). Baseflow has not remained constant over the study period, and the results of the trend detection from the Mann–Kendall test reveal that baseflows have increased and are the strongest from May to September. This analysis is confirmed by quantile regression, which suggests that for most of the year, the largest changes are detected in the central part of the distribution. Although increasing baseflow trends are widespread throughout the region, decreasing trends are few and limited to Kansas and Nebraska. Further analysis reveals that baseflow changes are being driven by both climate and land use change across the region. Increasing trends in baseflow are linked to increases in precipitation throughout the year and are most prominent during May and June. Changes in agricultural intensity (in terms of harvested corn and soybean acreage) are linked to increasing trends in the central and western Midwest, whereas increasing temperatures may lead to decreasing baseflow trends in spring and summer in northern Wisconsin, Kansas, and Nebraska.},

	abstract = {Runoff prediction in ungauged and scarcely gauged catchments is a key research field in surface water hydrology. There have been numerous studies before and since the launch of the predictions in ungauged basins ({PUB}) initiative by the International Association of Hydrological Sciences in 2003. This study critically reviews and assesses the decadal progress in the regionalization of hydrological modeling, which is the major tool for {PUB}, from 2000 to 2019. This paper found that the journal publications have noticeably increased in terms of {PUB} in the past 7 years, and research countries have been expanded dramatically since 2013. The regionalization methods are grouped into three categories including similarity-based, regression-based, and hydrological signature-based. There are more detailed researches focusing on the interdisciplinary and profound improvement of each regionalization method. Namely, tremendous efforts have been made and lots of improvements have been carried out in the parameterization domain for the post-{PUB} period. However, there is still plenty of room to improve the prediction capability in data-sparse regions (e.g., further verification and proof of multi-modeling adaptation and uncertainties description). This paper also discusses possible research directions in the future, including {PUB} in a changing environment and better utilization of multi-source remote-sensing information.},

Although estimates of future {GWR} are needed for water resource management, they are uncertain in cold and humid climates due to the wide range in possible future climatic conditions. This work aims to (1) simulate the impacts of climate change on regional {GWR} for a cold and humid climate and (2) identify precipitation and temperature changes leading to signiﬁcant long-term changes in {GWR}. Spatially distributed {GWR} is simulated in a case study for the southern Province of Quebec (Canada, 36,000 km2) using a water budget model. Climate scenarios from global climate models indicate warming temperatures and wetter conditions ({RCP}4.5 and {RCP}8.5; 1951–2100). The results show that annual precipitation increases of {\textgreater}+150 mm/yr or winter precipitation increases of {\textgreater}+25 mm will lead to signiﬁcantly higher {GWR}. {GWR} is expected to decrease if the precipitation changes are lower than these thresholds. Signiﬁcant {GWR} changes are produced only when the temperature change exceeds +2 ◦C. Temperature changes of {\textgreater}+4.5 ◦C limit the {GWR} increase to +30 mm/yr. This work provides useful insights into the regional assessment of future {GWR} in cold and humid climates, thus helping in planning decisions as climate change unfolds. The results are expected to be comparable to those in other regions with similar climates in post-glacial geological environments and future climate change conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Groundwater recharge ({GWR}) is a strategic hydrologic
variable, and its estimate is necessary to implement sustainable groundwater management. This is especially true in a global warming context that highly
impacts key winter conditions in cold and humid climates. For this reason,
long-term simulations are particularly useful for understanding past changes in {GWR} associated with changing climatic conditions. However, {GWR} simulation at
the regional scale and for long-term conditions is challenging, especially
due to the limited availability of spatially distributed calibration data and due to generally short observed time series. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the relevance of using a water budget model to understand
long-term transient and regional-scale {GWR} in cold and humid climates where
groundwater observations are scarce. The {HydroBudget} model was specifically
developed for regional-scale simulations in cold and humid climate
conditions. The model uses commonly available data such as runoff curve
numbers to describe the study area, precipitation and temperature time series to run the model, and river flow rates and baseflow estimates for its
automatic calibration. A typical case study is presented for the southern
portion of the Province of Quebec (Canada, 36 000 km2). With the model
simultaneously calibrated on 51 gauging stations, the first {GWR} estimate for
the region was simulated between 1961 and 2017 with very little uncertainty
(≤ 10 mm/yr). The simulated water budget was divided into 41 \% runoff
(444 mm/yr), 47 \% evapotranspiration (501 mm/yr), and 12 \% {GWR}
(139 mm/yr), with preferential {GWR} periods during spring and winter (44 \%
and 32 \% of the annual {GWR}, respectively), values that are typical of other cold and humid climates. Snowpack evolution and soil frost were shown to be
a key feature for {GWR} simulation in these environments. One of the
contributions of the study was to show that the model sensitivity to its
parameters was correlated with the average air temperature, with colder watersheds more sensitive to snow-related parameters than warmer watersheds.
Interestingly, the results showed that the significant increase in precipitation and temperature since the early 1960s did not lead to
significant changes in the annual {GWR} but resulted in increased runoff and
evapotranspiration. In contrast to previous studies of past {GWR} trends in
cold and humid climates, this work has shown that changes in past climatic
conditions have not yet produced significant changes in annual {GWR}. Because
of their relative ease of use, water budget models are a useful approach for
scientists, modelers, and stakeholders alike to understand regional-scale groundwater renewal rates in cold and humid climates, especially if they can
be easily adapted to specific study needs and environments.},

	abstract = {River Environment Classification ({REC}) is a new system for classifying river environments that is based on climate, topography, geology, and land cover factors that control spatial patterns in river ecosystems. {REC} builds on existing principles for environmental regionalization and introduces three specific additions to the “ecoregion” approach. First, the {REC} assumes that ecological patterns are dependent on a range of factors and associated landscape scale processes, some of which may show significant variation within an ecoregion. {REC} arranges the controlling factors in a hierarchy with each level defining the cause of ecological variation at a given characteristic scale. Second, {REC} assumes that ecological characteristics of rivers are responses to fluvial (i.e., hydrological and hydraulic) processes. Thus, {REC} uses a network of channels and associated watersheds to classify specific sections of river. When mapped, {REC} has the form of a linear mosaic in which classes change in the downstream direction as the integrated characteristics of the watershed change, producing longitudinal spatial patterns that are typical of river ecosystems. Third, {REC} assigns individual river sections to a class independently and objectively according to criteria that result in a geographically independent framework in which classes may show wide geographic dispersion rather than the geographically dependent schemes that result from the ecoregion approach. {REC} has been developed to provide a multiscale spatial framework for river management and has been used to map the rivers of New Zealand at a 1:50,000 mapping scale.},

Trends were determined for annual maximum, annual mean, and annual median baseflow. Baseflow values derived at 574 stations in the {USA} for the 44 years from 1970 through 2013 are analyzed using two nonparametric trend tests (Spearman’s rho ({SR}) test and Mann-Kendall ({MK})). Results from the trend tests are compiled for 18 major regions to understand the spatial variability of changes in baseflows across the {USA}. Results from {SR} tests indicate that almost half of the stations show statistically significant trends in annual maximum baseflows. Trends in annual median baseflows show that 32.06\% of the gauging stations have downward trends, and a total of 56.45\% of sites show significant trends for annual mean baseflows. The Souris-Red-Rainy, Missouri, and California watershed regions have a larger number of sites with higher upward trends compared with those from other regions in the {USA}. The results from the {SR} test indicate that 262 sites have statistically significant trends in annual maximum baseflow compared with the 254 sites with similar trends noted from the {MK} test. Based on limited data, it can be concluded that baseflow and precipitation values accumulated for the same month are correlated in some regions. In general, the number of sites with decreasing trends for annual maximum, mean, and median baseflows is larger than the number of sites with increasing trends. Decreasing trends in baseflows are cause for concern and have serious implications on future planning for low flow management strategies for several streams in the {USA}.},

However, recent innovations in baseﬂow recession analysis have allowed novel ﬁndings regarding the variability of both the stability of baseﬂow and its nonlinearity (i.e., the concavity of the hydrograph), as well as the regional clustering of these characteristics. We investigate spatial and temporal patterns in the character of baseﬂow recession for over 1,000 watersheds in the continental United States. We discover seasonal patterns in both the stability and nonlinearity of baseﬂow which vary systematically across large regions. Further, we relate these baseﬂow characteristics to their potential physical drivers, including estimates of evapotranspiration, watershed storage, the distribution of watershed storage, and precipitation. While coincident watershed storage is the best predictor of baseﬂow stability in many regions (particularly the Appalachian Mountains), evapotranspiration from 2 to 3 months previous is the best predictor of baseﬂow stability in other regions (particularly the Paciﬁc Northwest). We also discuss the novel ﬁnding that baseﬂow nonlinearity has increased signiﬁcantly in most watersheds across the United States since 1980.},

Understanding its future changes is a major concern for water supply and ecosystem health. This study examines the impacts of climate and agriculture on monthly baseflow in the U.S. Midwest through the end of the 21st century. We use a statistical approach to evaluate three scenarios. The first scenario is based on downscaled and bias corrected global climate model ({GCM}) outputs and the representative concentration pathway ({RCP}) 8.5, and agriculture is held constant (and equal to the mean from 2013 to 2019). In the next two scenarios, climate is held constant (2010–2019) to isolate the impact of agriculture on baseflow. In terms of agricultural changes, we consider scenarios representative of either increases or decreases with respect to the production of corn and soybeans. Changes in the climate system point to increases in baseflow that are likely a result of increased precipitation and antecedent wetness. Seasonally, warmer temperature in the winter and spring (i.e., February to July) is expected to cause increasing trends in baseflow. Changes in land use showed that agriculture would either mitigate the impact of climate change or possibly amplify it. Expanding corn and soybean areas would increase baseflow in the Corn Belt region. On the other hand, converting land back to perennial vegetation would decrease baseflow throughout the entire year. Despite its simplicity, this study can provide basic information to understand where to expect adverse effects on baseflow and thus improve land management practices in those areas.},

	abstract = {Groundwater recharge and discharge (base ﬂow) estimates from two methods were compared in the Upper Mississippi River basin ({USGS} hydrologic cataloging unit 07). The Upper Mississippi basin drains 491,700 km2 in Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, and Wisconsin and outlets in the Mississippi River north of Cairo, Illinois. The ﬁrst method uses the water balance components from the soil and water assessment tool model ({SWAT}). The model was used to simulate the daily water balance of approximately 16 soil/land use hydrologic response units ({HRU}) within each of the 131 {USGS} 8-digit watersheds. The water balance of each {HRU} is simulated with four storages: snow, soil (up to ten layers), shallow aquifer, and deep aquifer. Groundwater recharge is deﬁned as water that percolates past the bottom soil layer into the shallow aquifer. Recharge is lagged to become base ﬂow and can also be lost to {ET}. The second method consists of two procedures to estimate base ﬂow and recharge from daily stream ﬂow: (1) a digital recursive ﬁlter to separate base ﬂow from daily ﬂow and (2) a modiﬁed hydrograph recession curve displacement technique to estimate groundwater recharge. These procedures were applied to 283 {USGS} stations ranging in area from 50 to 1200 km2. A smoothed surface was obtained using a thin plate spline technique and estimates were averaged for each 8-digit basin. Simulated ﬂow was calibrated against average annual ﬂow for each 8-digit. Without further calibration, simulated monthly stream ﬂow was compared against measured ﬂow at Alton, Illinois (445,000 km2) from 1961–1980. To validate the model, measured and simulated monthly stream ﬂow at Alton from 1981–1985 were compared with an R2 of 0.65. No attempt was made to calibrate base ﬂow and recharge independent of total stream ﬂow. Base ﬂow and recharge from both methods were shown to be in general agreement. The ﬁlter and recession methods have the potential to provide realistic estimates of base ﬂow and recharge for input into regional groundwater models and as a check for surface hydrologic models.

	abstract = {Baseflow, the groundwater contribution to streamflow, sustains surface water between precipitation events and is an important indicator of groundwater availability. Although many site-specific studies have been completed, there are few studies of long-term Canada-wide baseflow trends. In this work, we detected monthly baseflow trends across Canada and related them to changes to climatic predictors (precipitation, temperature, and ante­ cedent wetness) using streamflow data from 1275 hydrometer stations from 1989 to 2019. Lyne and Hollick’s one-parameter digital filter is used to obtain a baseflow time series and monotonic trends are identified using the Mann-Kendall Trend Test. Historical baseflow is related to climate parameters by means of Generalised Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape ({GAMLSS}) statistical analysis. Results based on trend analysis detected no significant trends for most stations (85.7\% of all stations and months). However, notable increasing trends were observed across most of southern Canada during the winter and spring months (October–April). Conversely, negative trends were detected from June to September in Alberta and British Columbia and in southern Northwest Territories. Model selection identified antecedent wetness most often as a climate predictor over the same period as trend analysis. Our results highlight that warmer temperatures and increased snow cover across much of Canada have contributed to increased baseflow likely from shifts in snow melt timing and volumes. During warmer months (June–August), results indicate that increases in temperature were related to decreased baseflow, likely through increased evapotranspiration. Many trends in baseflow were not related to any climate predictors. Furthermore, non-reference basins were twice as likely to have no climate predictor, indicating that anthropogenic activities may be driving changes in baseflow. The results of this work can inform water resources management to identify the direction of change in groundwater availability across Canada and regions where mitigation may be necessary.},

	abstract = {Baseflow is the portion of streamflow that comes from groundwater and subsurface sources. Although baseflow is essential for sustaining streams during low flow and drought periods, we have little information about how and why it has changed over large regions of the continental United States. The objective of this study was to evaluate how changes in the climate system have affected observed monthly baseflow records at 3,283 {USGS} gauges over the last 30 years (1989–2019). We developed a statistical modeling framework to determine the relationship between monthly baseflow and monthly climate predictors (i.e., precipitation, temperature, and antecedent wetness). Overall, we found that baseflow trends and the factors influencing them vary by region and month. In the {US} Northeast, increases were detected earlier in the year (February and March) and in the summer (May and June), and were likely due to increasing precipitation, warmer temperature, and subsequent changes in snowmelt. Increasing baseflow in the {US} Pacific Northwest and Midwest were associated with increases in precipitation and antecedent wetness throughout the year. Decreasing trends were located in the {US} Southeast and Southwest. Baseflow trends in the {US} Southeast were only detected in March, possibly as a result of decreased precipitation during the spring. On the other hand, decreases in baseflow in the Central Southwestern United States occurred throughout the year. These trends were associated with a lack of precipitation and increases in temperature. Finally, we examined the relationship between monthly baseflow trends and changes in total water storage using monthly Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mascon products from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In this study, trends in total water storage were strongly associated with baseflow trends across the United States. The spatial and temporal variability in baseflow response to climate reported here can aid water managers in adapting to future climate change. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){HE}.19435584.0002170. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear cluster analysis techniques including Self Organizing Maps ({SOMs}), standard Non-Linear Principal Component Analysis ({NLPCA}) and Compact Non-Linear Principal Component Analysis ({CompactNLPCA}) are investigated for the identiﬁcation of hydrologically homogeneous clusters of watersheds across Ontario, Canada. The results of classiﬁcation based on catchment attributes and streamﬂow series of Ontario watersheds are compared to those of two benchmarks: the standard Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) and K-means classiﬁcation based on recently proposed runoff signatures. The latter classiﬁed the 90 watersheds into four homogeneous groups used as a reference classiﬁcation to evaluate the performance of the nonlinear clustering techniques. The similarity index between the ﬁrst largest group of the reference classiﬁcation and the one from the {NLPCA} based on streamﬂow, is about 0.58. For the Compact-{NLPCA} the similarity is about 0.56 and for the {SOM} it is about 0.52. Furthermore, those results remain slightly the same when the watersheds are classiﬁed based on watershed attributes – suggesting that the nonlinear classiﬁcation methods can be robust tools for the classiﬁcation of ungauged watersheds prior to regionalization. Distinct patterns of ﬂow regime characteristics and speciﬁc dominant hydrological attributes are identiﬁed in the clusters obtained from the nonlinear classiﬁcation techniques – indicating that the classiﬁcations are sound from the hydrological point of view.},

During the last two decades, a considerable effort has gone into analysis and development of methodological approaches to hydrologic classiﬁcation. We reviewed the process of hydrologic classiﬁcation, differentiating between an approach based on deductive reasoning using environmental regionalization, hydrologic regionalization and environmental classiﬁcation whereby environmental variables assumed to be key determinants of hydrology are analysed and one based on inductive reasoning using streamﬂow classiﬁcation whereby hydrologic data are analysed directly. We explored past applications in ecohydrology, highlighting the utility of classiﬁcations in the extrapolation of hydrologic information across sparsely gauged landscapes, the description of spatial patterns in hydrologic variability, aiding water resource management, and in the identiﬁcation and prioritization of conservation areas. We introduce an overarching methodological framework that depicts critical components of the classiﬁcation process and summarize important advantages and disadvantages of commonly used statistical approaches to characterize and predict hydrologic classes. Our hope is that researchers and managers will be better informed when having to make decisions regarding the selection and proper implementation of methods for hydrologic classiﬁcation in the future.

Spatial variation in ﬂow regimes among streams is reasonably well understood for streams in mesic regions, but a more robust characterization of ﬂow regimes in arid regions is needed, especially to support biological monitoring and assessment programs. In this paper, we used long-term (41 years) records of mean daily streamﬂow from 287 stream reaches in the arid and semi-arid western {USA} to develop and compare several alternative ﬂow-regime classiﬁcations. We also evaluated how accurately we could predict the ﬂow-regime classes of ungauged reaches. Over the 41-year record examined (water years 1972–2013), the gauged reaches varied continuously from always having ﬂow {\textgreater} zero to seldom having ﬂow. We predicted ephemeral and perennial reaches with less error than reaches with an intermediate number of zero-ﬂow days or years. We illustrate application of our approach by predicting the ﬂow-regime classes at ungauged reaches in Arizona, {USA}. Maps based on these predictions were generally consistent with qualitative expectations of how ﬂow regimes vary spatially across Arizona. These results represent a promising step toward more effective assessment and management of streams in arid regions.},

We used long-term daily flow measurements from 601 gauged streams whose watersheds were in relatively natural condition to characterize spatial variation in 16 flow regime variables selected for their ecological importance. Principal component analysis of these 16 variables produced five uncorrelated factors that described patterns of spatial covariation in flow regimes. These five factors were associated with low flow, magnitude, flashiness, timing, and constancy characteristics of the daily flow regime. We applied hierarchical clustering to the five flow factors to classify the 601 streams into three coarses and eight more finely resolved flow regime classes. We then developed a random forest model that used watershed and climate attributes to predict the probabilities that streams belonged to each of the eight finely resolved flow regime classes. The model had a prediction accuracy (per cent correct classification) of 75\%. We used the random forest model with downscaled climate (precipitation and temperature) projections to predict site-specific changes in flow regime classes expected by 2100. Thirty-three per cent of the 601 sites were predicted to change to a different flow regime class by 2100. Snow-fed streams in the western {USA} were predicted to be less likely to change regimes, whereas both small, perennial, rain-fed streams and intermittent streams in the central and eastern {USA} were predicted to be most likely to change regime.

We trained and tested several {LSTMs} on 531 basins from the {CAMELS} data set using k-fold validation, so that predictions were made in basins that supplied no training data. The training and test data set included ∼30 years of daily rainfall-runoff data from catchments in the United States ranging in size from 4 to 2,000 km2 with aridity index from 0.22 to 5.20, and including 12 of the 13 {IGPB} vegetated land cover classifications. This effectively “ungauged” model was benchmarked over a 15-year validation period against the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting ({SAC}-{SMA}) model and also against the {NOAA} National Water Model reanalysis. {SAC}-{SMA} was calibrated separately for each basin using 15 years of daily data. The out-of-sample {LSTM} had higher median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiencies across the 531 basins (0.69) than either the calibrated {SAC}-{SMA} (0.64) or the National Water Model (0.58). This indicates that there is (typically) sufficient information in available catchment attributes data about similarities and differences between catchment-level rainfall-runoff behaviors to provide out-of-sample simulations that are generally more accurate than current models under ideal (i.e., calibrated) conditions. We found evidence that adding physical constraints to the {LSTM} models might improve simulations, which we suggest motivates future research related to physics-guided machine learning.},

We argue that one reason is the difficulty to interpret the internals of trained networks. In this study, we look at the application of {LSTMs} for rainfall-runoff forecasting, one of the central tasks in the field of hydrology, in which the river discharge has to be predicted from meteorological observations. {LSTMs} are particularly well-suited for this problem since memory cells can represent dynamic reservoirs and storages, which are essential components in state-space modelling approaches of the hydrological system. On basis of two different catchments, one with snow influence and one without, we demonstrate how the trained model can be analyzed and interpreted. In the process, we show that the network internally learns to represent patterns that are consistent with our qualitative understanding of the hydrological system.Kratzert, {FrederikHerrnegger}, {MathewKlotz}, {DanielHochreiter}, {SeppKlambauer}, Günther},

	abstract = {The volume and sustainability of streamﬂow from headwaters to downstream reaches commonly depend on contributions from ground water. Streams that begin in extensive aquifers generally have a stable point of origin and substantial discharge in their headwaters. In contrast, streams that begin as discharge from rocks or sediments having low permeability have a point of origin that moves up and down the channel seasonally, have small incipient discharge, and commonly go dry. Nearly all streams need to have some contribution from ground water in order to provide reliable habitat for aquatic organisms. Natural processes and human activities can have a substantial effect on the ﬂow of streams between their headwaters and downstream reaches. Streams lose water to ground water when and where their head is higher than the contiguous water table. Although very common in arid regions, loss of stream water to ground water also is relatively common in humid regions. Evaporation, as well as transpiration from riparian vegetation, causing ground-water levels to decline also can cause loss of stream water. Human withdrawal of ground water commonly causes streamﬂow to decline, and in some regions has caused streams to cease ﬂowing.},

	abstract = {Cumulatively, headwater streams contribute to maintaining hydrologic connectivity and ecosystem integrity at regional scales. Hydrologic connectivity is the water-mediated transport of matter, energy and organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. Headwater streams compose over two-thirds of total stream length in a typical river drainage and directly connect the upland and riparian landscape to the rest of the stream ecosystem. Altering headwater streams, e.g., by channelization, diversion through pipes, impoundment and burial, modiﬁes ﬂuxes between uplands and downstream river segments and eliminates distinctive habitats. The large-scale ecological effects of altering headwaters are ampliﬁed by land uses that alter runoff and nutrient loads to streams, and by widespread dam construction on larger rivers (which frequently leaves free-ﬂowing upstream portions of river systems essential to sustaining aquatic biodiversity). We discuss three examples of large-scale consequences of cumulative headwater alteration. Downstream eutrophication and coastal hypoxia result, in part, from agricultural practices that alter headwaters and wetlands while increasing nutrient runoff. Extensive headwater alteration is also expected to lower secondary productivity of river systems by reducing stream-system length and trophic subsidies to downstream river segments, affecting aquatic communities and terrestrial wildlife that utilize aquatic resources. Reduced viability of freshwater biota may occur with cumulative headwater alteration, including for species that occupy a range of stream sizes but for which headwater streams diversify the network of interconnected populations or enhance survival for particular life stages. Developing a more predictive understanding of ecological patterns that may emerge on regional scales as a result of headwater alterations will require studies focused on components and pathways that connect headwaters to river, coastal and terrestrial ecosystems. Linkages between headwaters and downstream ecosystems cannot be discounted when addressing large-scale issues such as hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and global losses of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Non-perennial streams comprise over half of the global stream network and impact downstream water quality. Although aridity is a primary driver of stream drying globally, surface flow permanence varies spatially and temporally within many headwater streams, suggesting that these complex drying patterns may be driven by topographic and subsurface factors. Indeed, these factors affect shallow groundwater flows in perennial systems, but there has been only limited characterisation of shallow groundwater residence times and groundwater contributions to intermittent streams. Here, we asked how groundwater residence times, shallow groundwater contributions to streamflow, and topography interact to control stream drying in headwater streams. We evaluated this overarching question in eight semi-arid headwater catchments based on surface flow observations during the low-flow period, coupled with tracer-based groundwater residence times. For one headwater catchment, we analysed stream drying during the seasonal flow recession and rewetting period using a sensor network that was interspersed between groundwater monitoring locations, and linked drying patterns to groundwater inputs and topography. We found a poor relationship between groundwater residence times and flowing network extent (R2 {\textless} 0.24). Although groundwater residence times indicated that old groundwater was present in all headwater streams, surface drying also occurred in each of them, suggesting old, deep flowpaths are insufficient to sustain surface flows. Indeed, the timing of stream drying at any given point typically coincided with a decrease in the contribution from near-surface sources and an increased relative contribution of groundwater to streamflow at that location, whereas the spatial pattern of drying within the stream network typically correlated with locations where groundwater inputs were most seasonally variable. Topographic metrics only explained \$30\% of the variability in seasonal flow permanence, and surprisingly, we found no correlation with seasonal drying and down-valley subsurface storage area. Because we found complex spatial patterns, future studies should pair dense spatial observations of subsurface properties, such as hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity, to observations of seasonal flow permanence.},

The Supreme Court’s majority opinion addressed broader issues of {CWA} jurisdiction by implying that the {CWA} intended some ‘‘connection’’ to navigability and that isolated waters need a ‘‘signiﬁcant nexus’’ to navigable waters to be jurisdictional. Subsequent to this decision ({SWANCC}), there have been many lawsuits challenging {CWA} jurisdiction, many of which are focused on headwater, intermittent, and ephemeral streams. To inform the legal and policy debate surrounding this issue, we present information on the geographic distribution of headwater streams and intermittent and ephemeral streams throughout the U.S., summarize major ﬁndings from the scientiﬁc literature in considering hydrological connectivity between headwater streams and downstream waters, and relate the scientiﬁc information presented to policy issues surrounding the scope of waters protected under the {CWA}. Headwater streams comprise approximately 53\% (2,900,000 km) of the total stream length in the U.S., excluding Alaska, and intermittent and ephemeral streams comprise approximately 59\% (3,200,000 km) of the total stream length and approximately 50\% (1,460,000 km) of the headwater stream length in the U.S., excluding Alaska. Hillslopes, headwater streams, and downstream waters are best described as individual elements of integrated hydrological systems. Hydrological connectivity allows for the exchange of mass, momentum, energy, and organisms longitudinally, laterally, vertically, and temporally between headwater streams and downstream waters. Via hydrological connectivity, headwater, intermittent and ephemeral streams cumulatively contribute to the functional integrity of downstream waters; hydrologically and ecologically, they are a part of the tributary system. As this debate continues, scientiﬁc input from multiple ﬁelds will be important for policymaking at the federal, state, and local levels and to inform water resource management regardless of the level at which those decisions are being made. Strengthening the interface between science, policy, and public participation is critical if we are going to achieve effective water resource management.},

We propose a series of research questions to address these gaps and, ﬁnally, hypothesize and discuss the most effective ways to protect headwater streams in urbanizing environments given our current state of understanding. Of particular importance are the need to 1) shift perceptions of these systems as dry, insigniﬁcant depressions in the landscape; 2) manage both the headwater stream catchment and the channel; and 3) prioritize protection of the natural ﬂow regime.},

	abstract = {Headwater streams dominate natural landscapes and provide essential functions for downstream waters. However, because of minimal legal protection, they often are piped or buried to accommodate urban growth. Urbanization also alters stream base flows. The combined impact of these factors on channel location is unknown. We assessed the effects of urbanization on the location and length of ephemeral, intermittent, and perennial streams. We randomly selected 150 of 6686 potential channel origins in Hamilton County (Cincinnati), Ohio, {USA}, for field assessments, and mapped 122 ephemeral, 74 intermittent, and 45 perennial flow origins in these channels. On average, 1:100,000- and 1:24,000-scale {US} Geological Survey maps underestimated channel length by 85\% and 78\%, respectively. Mean catchment areas for ephemeral and intermittent flow origins were smaller in forested (0.66 ha and 3.60 ha, respectively) than in urban areas (5.13 ha and 6.79 ha, respectively). These values indicate 93\% and 46\% county-wide losses of ephemeral and intermittent channel length, respectively, with urbanization. In contrast, the mean catchment area for perennial flow origins was larger in forested (48.12 ha) than in urban (31.22 ha) areas, resulting in a 22\% gain in perennial channel length with urban development. Increased perennial channel length was partially explained by reduced forest cover, a result suggesting that reduced evapotranspiration can significantly increase stream base flows. Most variation (59–74\%) in catchment area of ephemeral, intermittent, and perennial flow origins was explained by catchment relief, with higher relief corresponding to smaller catchments. Urbanization can decrease (e.g., via reduced infiltration) or increase (e.g., via lawn irrigation and septic tanks) the permanence of flows, thus confounding any overall effect of urban land cover on hydrologic permanence. Site-specific differences in physiography (e.g., bedrock, springs) and landscape management (e.g., stream impoundments) suggest that field surveys are necessary for accurate stream delineation. These results highlight the extensive effects of urbanization on the presence and hydrologic permanence of headwater streams, raise issues with current jurisdictional policy in the {US}, and emphasize the need to examine the cumulative effects of headwater stream loss on downstream ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Regional Climate Models ({RCMs}) emerged 30 years ago as a transient tool to provide detailed estimates of meteorological parameters (temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind, and others) for regional applications. Their dynamic downscaling approach was intended to fill the gap between the global but coarse estimates of Global Climate/Circulation Models ({GCMs}), which typically had a 2.5° resolution, and practical requirements such as estimating precipitation for hydrologic operations in small basins under conditions of increased greenhouse gas emissions. Over the three decades, {RCMs} provided data to inform policies and helped to increase knowledge of the present climate and the impacts of global warming at regional level. This paper describes the major achievements of {RCMs}, critically reviewing the main issues and limitations that have been featured in the literature. It puts forward a controversial claim aimed at starting a debate in the climate community, namely, that the cycle of {RCM} research has reached an end for informing policies. This is because these models have recently been superseded for that purpose by high-resolution {GCMs} and Earth System Models ({ESM}).},

This paper aims to investigate the challenges in modeling because of different parameter or variable or model conceptualization uncertainties using different scenarios, downscaling methods and climatic variables.

The problem currently is that traditional hydrological models degrade significantly in performance when calibrated for multiple basins together instead of for a single basin alone. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven approach using Long Short-Term Memory networks ({LSTMs}) and demonstrate that under a “big data” paradigm, this is not necessarily the case. By training a single {LSTM} model on 531 basins from the {CAMELS} dataset using meteorological time series data and static catchment attributes, we were able to significantly improve performance compared to a set of several different hydrological benchmark models. Our proposed approach not only significantly outperforms hydrological models that were calibrated regionally, but also achieves better performance than hydrological models that were calibrated for each basin individually. Furthermore, we propose an adaption to the standard {LSTM} architecture, which we call an Entity-Aware-{LSTM} ({EA}-{LSTM}), that allows for learning catchment similarities as a feature layer in a deep learning model. We show that these learned catchment similarities correspond well to what we would expect from prior hydrological understanding.},

	abstract = {The impact of projected 21st century climate conditions on streamflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin was estimated using a multi-model ensemble approach wherein the downscaled outputs of 112 future climate projections from 16 global climate models ({GCMs}) were used to drive a macroscale hydrology model. By the middle of the century, the impacts on streamflow range, over the entire ensemble, from a decrease of approximately 30\% to an increase of approximately the same magnitude. Although prior studies and associated media coverage have focused heavily on the likelihood of a drier future for the Colorado River Basin, approximately 25 to 35\% of the ensemble of runs, by 2099 and 2039, respectively, result in no change or increases in streamflow. The broad range of projected impacts is primarily the result of uncertainty in projections of future precipitation, and a relatively small part of the variability of precipitation across the projections can be attributed to the effect of emissions pathways. The simulated evolution of future temperature is strongly influenced by emissions, but temperature has a smaller influence than precipitation on flow. Period change statistics (i.e., the change in flow from one 30-yr period to another) vary as much within a model ensemble as between models and emissions pathways. Even by the end of the current century, the variability across the projections is much greater than changes in the ensemble mean. The relatively large ensemble analysis described herein provides perspective on earlier studies that have used fewer scenarios, and suggests that impact analyses relying on one or a few climate scenarios are unacceptably influenced by the choice of projections.},

The basin's hydrological responses to climate forcing in the projected period are analysed under two representative concentration pathways ({RCPs}). Trends in the projected period relative to the reference period are determined for medium, high and low flows. Flood characteristics are estimated using the threshold level approach. The analysis of variance technique ({ANOVA}) is used to segregate the contribution from {RCMs}, {RCPs}, and internal variability ({IV}) to the total uncertainty in streamflow projections. Results show a robust positive trend for streamflows. Flood volumes may increase by 11.7\% in {RCP}4.5 (2006–2030), 76.4\% in {RCP}4.5 (2025–2049), 20.3\% in {RCP}8.5 (2006–2030), and 342.4\% in {RCP}8.5 (2025–2049), respectively, for Jamshedpur. For Ghatshila, increment in flow volume is estimated as 15.7\% in {RCP}4.5 (2006–2025), 24.2\% in {RCP}4.5 (2025–2049), 35.9\% in {RCP}8.5 (2006–2030), and 224.6\% in {RCP}8.5 (2025–2049), respectively.

	abstract = {The western United States is a region long defined by water challenges. Climate change adds to those historical challenges, but does not, for the most part, introduce entirely new challenges; rather climate change is likely to stress water supplies and resources already in many cases stretched to, or beyond, natural limits. Projections are for continued and, likely, increased warming trends across the region, with a near certainty of continuing changes in seasonality of snowmelt and streamflows, and a strong potential for attendant increases in evaporative demands. Projections of future precipitation are less conclusive, although likely the northernmost West will see precipitation increases while the southernmost West sees declines. However, most of the region lies in a broad area where some climate models project precipitation increases while others project declines, so that only increases in precipitation uncertainties can be projected with any confidence. Changes in annual and seasonal hydrographs are likely to challenge water managers, users, and attempts to protect or restore environmental flows, even where annual volumes change little. Other impacts from climate change (e.g., floods and water-quality changes) are poorly understood and will likely be location dependent. In this context, four iconic river basins offer glimpses into specific challenges that climate change may bring to the West. The Colorado River is a system in which overuse and growing demands are projected to be even more challenging than climate-change-induced flow reductions. The Rio Grande offers the best example of how climate-change-induced flow declines might sink a major system into permanent drought. The Klamath is currently projected to face the more benign precipitation future, but fisheries and irrigation management may face dire straits due to warming air temperatures, rising irrigation demands, and warming waters in a basin already hobbled by tensions between endangered fisheries and agricultural demands. Finally, California's Bay-Delta system is a remarkably localized and severe weakness at the heart of the region's trillion-dollar economy. It is threatened by the full range of potential climate-change impacts expected across the West, along with major vulnerabilities to increased flooding and rising sea levels.},

Here, we modified the Water Supply Stress Index ({WaSSI}) model to provide estimates of mean water yield and the proportion of mean flow originating on forested lands at the 12-Digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale across the conterminous United States ({CONUS}). We accounted for the benefits of forests for drinking water supply and receiving populations through {IBTs} by incorporating a new {IBT} database, surface intake location information for public drinking water systems, and modeled water yield from forests. We compiled the new database of 594 {IBTs} ranging from 0.01 million m3 yr−1 to 8,900 million m3 yr−1, for a total transferred volume of 116,894 million m3 yr−1. According to our results, forested lands comprised 28.7\% of the total land area across {CONUS}, but contributed 46\% of the total surface water yield. Approximately 125.5 million people derived more than 10\% of their surface drinking water supply from forested lands, and 83.1 million people received more than 50\% of their surface drinking water supply from forested lands. Of those 83.1 million people receiving more than 50\% of their surface drinking water supply from forested lands, 19.4 million people obtained some (≥0.01\%) of that water through {IBTs}. We conclude that accounting for {IBTs} is critical to accurately assess the contribution of forested watersheds for surface drinking water supply. Hydrologic models for assessment and decision making must include {IBTs} to fully account for the effects of climate change and human population dynamics on water resource availability at watershed to regional scales. Results from this study can aid water resource and forest managers in developing integrated watershed management plans at a time when climate change, population growth, and land use change threaten water supplies.},

	abstract = {Headwaters make up a large part of the global stream length. They are also especially sensitive to droughts, which affect the stream’s water balance, chemistry, and ecology. Climate change scenarios predict an increasing frequency of extreme weather events. For streams, rivers, and their catchments, this implies a higher intensity and frequency of severer droughts and ﬂoods. It is likely that during drought streams depend to a signiﬁcant extent on groundwater to maintain ﬂow. This study contributes to ongoing research on the effects of drought on headwater catchments and the role of groundwater in the water balance of these systems. Monthly Radon (222Rn) measurements combined with mass balance calculations were used to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater inﬂux to the Mähringsbach, a headwater catchment in northern Bavaria, Germany. Sampling was conducted in 2019 and 2020, a multi-year drought period, with 2019 being the seventh driest year since the start of records. Thus measurements covered a broad range of ﬂow regimes (0.04 m3 s−1 to ∼ 3 m3 s−1). 222Rn activities ranged between ∼500 Bq m−3 and ∼8,500 Bq m−3 in the headwater, while further downstream, the activities and variability in activities were lower (∼500 Bq m−3 to ∼2,000 Bq m−3). Results from the 222Rn mass balance showed that in the headwater reaches, the proportion of groundwater varied between 10 and 70 \%, while further downstream, it ranged between only 0 and 30\%. There was a clear negative correlation between river discharge and the proportion of groundwater inﬂow to the stream. Less than 10\% of the total discharge was derived from groundwater during high ﬂow conditions, while under low ﬂow in the headwater reaches, it increased to 70\%. We conclude that aquatic ecosystems in headwaters become increasingly dependent on groundwater during drought periods as a source of water. This dependency will increase in the summer months given current climate predictions. This knowledge should be used to develop, reﬁne, and apply management strategies for streams and the important habitats located in stream sediments (hyporheic zone) under a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Baseﬂow is the slowly varying portion of streamﬂow, and it is essential for sustaining river ﬂows. Several methods have been developed for separating baseﬂow from streamﬂow. However, due to the lack of measured baseﬂow, past studies generally compared these baseﬂow separation methods qualitatively based on their hydrologic plausibility. To quantitively determine which baseﬂow separation method has the best accuracy, this study established a reliable evaluation criterion that relies only on measured streamﬂow. By applying the evaluation criterion to 1815 catchments across the contiguous United States, 9 baseﬂow separation methods including 4 graphic methods and 5 digital ﬁlter methods were evaluated. The evaluation result shows that the digital ﬁlter method proposed by Eckhardt (2005) has the best performance, and its performance is independent of catchment characteristics. Thus, Eckhardt digital ﬁlter method is recommended for baseﬂow separation across the contiguous United States.},

	abstract = {Digital filters are useful tools for assessing the contribution of groundwater to total river flow. Several of those filters have been proposed in the last decades. One of the last contributions on this subject was given by Ekchardt (2005) who proposed a more general form of a digital baseflow filter and showed that some of the most used filters are special cases of this general form. This new filter has the inconvenience of having two parameters, one of them may be obtained directly from recession analysis, but the other (maximum baseflow index ({BFImax})) is routinely estimated by a priori defined values according to the predominant geological characteristics of the drainage basin. In this short communication, we propose a method to estimate {BFImax} by a backwards filtering operation. The method was applied using data from 15 gauging stations in Brazil, with a varied range of groundwater contribution to streamflow. Results of the new estimation method for the {BFImax} parameter are coherent with the values which would be adopted by considering geological characteristics of the river basins.

However, it is difﬁcult to validate these methods due to the current challenges of measuring baseﬂow in the ﬁeld. In this study, simulation of a synthetic catchment’s response to rainfall is carried out using a fully integrated surface water-groundwater ﬂow model. A series of rainfall events with differing recovery periods and varied antecedent moisture conditions is considered to span a range of different streamﬂow generation dynamics. Baseﬂow is estimated for the outlet hydrograph of the synthetic catchment using a selection of commonly used automated baseﬂow separation methods. These estimates are compared to the baseﬂow signal obtained from the numerical model, which serves as the control experiment. Results from these comparisons show that depending on the method used, automated baseﬂow separation underestimates the simulated baseﬂow by as much as 28\%, or overestimates it by up to 74\%, during rainfall events. No separation method is found to be clearly superior to the others, as the performance of the various methods varies with different soil types, antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall events. The differences between the various approaches clearly demonstrate that the baseﬂow separation methods investigated are not universally applicable.},

	abstract = {Predicting future climate change over a region of complex terrain, such as the western United States ({US}), remains challenging due to the low resolution of global climate models ({GCMs}). Yet the climate extremes of recent years in this region, such as floods, wildfires, and drought, are likely to intensify further as climate warms, underscoring the need for high-quality and high-resolution predictions. Here, we present an ensemble of dynamically downscaled simulations over the western {US} from 1980–2100 at 9 km grid spacing, driven by 16 latest-generation {GCMs}. This dataset is titled the Western {US} Dynamically Downscaled Dataset ({WUS}-D3).

 We describe the challenges of producing {WUS}-D3, including {GCM} selection and technical issues, and we evaluate the simulations' realism by comparing historical results to temperature and precipitation observations. The future downscaled climate change signals are shaped in physically credible ways by the regional model's more realistic coastlines and topography. (1) The mean warming signals are heavily influenced by more realistic snowpack. (2) Mean precipitation changes are often consistent with wetting on the windward side of mountain complexes, as warmer, moister air masses are uplifted orographically during precipitation events. (3) There are large fractional precipitation increases on the lee side of mountain complexes, leading to potentially significant changes in water resources and ecology in these arid landscapes. (4) Increases in precipitation extremes are generally larger than in the {GCMs}, driven by locally intensified atmospheric updrafts tied to sharper, more realistic gradients in topography. (5) Changes in temperature extremes are different from what is expected by a shift in mean temperature and are shaped by local atmospheric dynamics and land surface feedbacks. Because of its high resolution, comprehensiveness, and representation of relevant physical processes, this dataset presents a unique opportunity to evaluate societally relevant future changes in western {US} climate.},

Tests of the form of stream Øow recessions in 11 streams, during periods of no recharge, show that for most catchments the storage±discharge relationship is more strongly non-linear than the quadratic form. However, for the commonly occurring case of recessions of duration up to about 10 days, the linear model remains a very good approximation, using a biased value of the groundwater turnover time. In contrast, estimates, from the stream hydrograph, of recharge during a storm event are very sensitive to the form of the storage±discharge relationship. The results of this study also show great variability in the parameters of the recession algorithm from one recession to another, attributable to spatial variability in groundwater recharge. An extension of the linear model to `leaky' catchments, where the recession reaches zero Øow, has been tested on two data sets.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Several studies have focused on improving the performance of {LSTM} models; however, few studies have assessed the applicability of these {LSTM} models across different hydroclimate regions. This study investigated the single-basin trained local (one model for each basin), multi-basin trained regional (one model for one region), and grand (one model for several regions) models for predicting daily streamflow in water-limited Great Basin (18 basins) and energylimited New England (27 basins) regions in the United States using the {CAMELS} (Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies) data set. The results show a general pattern of higher accuracy in daily streamflow predictions from the regional model when compared to local or grand models for most basins in the New England region. For the Great Basin region, local models provided smaller errors for most basins and substantially lower for those basins with relatively larger errors from the regional and grand models. The evaluation of one-layer and three-layer {LSTM} network architectures trained with 1-day lag information indicates that the addition of model complexity by increasing the number of layers may not necessarily increase the model skill for improving streamflow predictions. Findings from our study highlight the strengths and limitations of {LSTM} models across contrasting hydroclimate regions in the United States, which could be useful for local and regional scale decisions using standalone or potential integration of data-driven {LSTM} models with physics-based hydrological models.},

Citizen scientists are experts in their local environments who, when asked, can improve scientific processes and products. To the degree that citizen scientists are relegated to data collection, we shortchange opportunities to advance science. Rather than merely critique, we present an evidence-based engagement approach for listening to citizen scientist participants and incorporating their input into science processes and products that can be retrofitted onto existing citizen science projects or integrated from a project’s inception. We offer this adaptable blueprint in four steps and illustrate this approach via a crowdsourced hydrology project on the Boyne River, {USA}. We show how engaging voices of citizen scientists at key points in the project improves both the products of science (a real-time ecohydrological model) and the process of conducting the science (adaptations to help improve data collection).

	abstract = {Significance
            Climate change is expected to alter streamflow volume and variability in watersheds throughout the world, which will have impacts on agricultural, aquatic, and urban environments. Human modifications such as the building of reservoirs and the extraction of water for agricultural and urban uses, however, are thought to mask climate-induced changes in streamflow. Using observed streamflow data from over 3,000 sites from 1981 to 2015, this work identifies negative trends in streamflow throughout the southern and western portions of the United States and positive trends across the eastern portion of the United States and Canada. Within these regions, streamflow trends from human-modified sites are similar to unimpacted sites, indicating that the signal of climate change is apparent in all streamflow systems.
          , 
            Changes in climate are driving an intensification of the hydrologic cycle and leading to alterations of natural streamflow regimes. Human disturbances such as dams, land-cover change, and water diversions are thought to obscure climate signals in hydrologic systems. As a result, most studies of changing hydroclimatic conditions are limited to areas with natural streamflow. Here, we compare trends in observed streamflow from natural and human-modified watersheds in the United States and Canada for the 1981–2015 water years to evaluate whether comparable responses to climate change are present in both systems. We find that patterns and magnitudes of trends in median daily streamflow, daily streamflow variability, and daily extremes in human-modified watersheds are similar to those from nearby natural watersheds. Streamflow in both systems show negative trends throughout the southern and western United States and positive trends throughout the northeastern United States, the northern Great Plains, and southern prairies of Canada. The trends in both natural and human-modified watersheds are linked to local trends in precipitation and reference evapotranspiration, demonstrating that water management and land-cover change have not substantially altered the effects of climate change on human-modified watersheds compared with nearby natural watersheds.},

	abstract = {The Midwest of the {USA} is a highly productive agricultural region, in part due to the installation of perforated subsurface pipes, known as tile drains that remove excess water from wet soils. Tile drains rapidly move water to nearby streams, influencing how quickly streamflow rises and falls (i.e., streamflow “flashiness”). Currently, there are no comprehensive studies that compare the extent to which tile drainage influences flashiness across large and diverse agricultural regions. We address this knowledge gap by examining growing-season (April–October) flashiness using the Richards-Baker Index ({RBI}) in 139 watersheds located throughout the Midwest. Using a spatial tile-drainage dataset, watersheds were split into low, medium, and high tile-drainage classes. We found no significant differences between the flashiness of these three classes using a one-way Kruskal–Wallis test. When watersheds were separated into infiltration groups to help control for different soil types, the high tiledrainage class {RBI} was significantly higher than the low tile-drainage class {RBI} in the high infiltration group. To further understand the causes of flashiness, additional environmental variables and their relationship to flashiness were examined using multivariate regression. In the low infiltration group, tile drainage significantly reduced flashiness, with watershed area and average depth to water table being the largest influences on flashiness. Tile drainage produced a larger reduction in flashiness in the high infiltration watersheds, with the largest influences being percent clay in the watershed and watershed area. These results indicate that the influence of tile drainage on flashiness emerges only after other watershed variables are accounted for. Given that tile drainage may increase in the future as precipitation patterns and extremes change, flashiness will likely continue to be modified. These results lead to an improved understanding of flood-generating and nutrient transport mechanisms that are relevant to stakeholders across a wide range of sectors.},

	abstract = {The Mississippi River Basin ({MRB}), the fourth-largest river basin in the world, is an important corridor for hydroelectric power generation, agricultural and industrial production, riverine transportation, and ecosystem goods and services. Historically, flooding of the Mississippi River has resulted in significant economic losses. In a future with an intensified global hydrological cycle, the altered discharge of the river may jeopardize communities and infrastructure situated in the floodplain. This study utilizes output from the Community Earth System Model version 2 ({CESM}2) large ensemble simulations spanning 1930 to 2100 to quantify changes in future {MRB} discharge under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario ({SSP}3–7.0). The simulations show that increasing precipitation trends exceed and dominate increased evapotranspiration ({ET}), driving an overall increase in total discharge in the Ohio and Lower Mississippi River basins. On a seasonal scale, reduced spring snowmelt is projected in the Ohio and Missouri River basins, leading to reduced spring runoff in those regions. However, decreased snowmelt and spring runoff is overshadowed by a larger increase in projected precipitation minus {ET} over the entire basin and leads to an increase in mean river discharge. This increase in discharge is linked to a relatively small increase in the magnitude of extreme floods (2 \% and 3 \% for 100-year and 1000-year floods, respectively) by the late 21st century relative to the late 20th century. Our analyses imply that under {SSP}3–7.0 forcing, the Mississippi River and Tributaries ({MR}\&T) project design flood would not be exceeded at the 100-year return period. Our results harbor implications for water resources management including increased vulnerability of the Mississippi River given projected changes in climate.},

Research over the last 15 years has led to an emerging consensus: the {PDO} is not a single phenomenon, but is instead the result of a combination of different physical processes, including both remote tropical forcing and local North Pacific atmosphere–ocean interactions, which operate on different time scales to drive similar {PDO}-like {SST} anomaly patterns. How these processes combine to generate the observed {PDO} evolution, including apparent regime shifts, is shown using simple autoregressive models of increasing spatial complexity. Simulations of recent climate in coupled {GCMs} are able to capture many aspects of the {PDO}, but do so based on a balance of processes often more independent of the tropics than is observed. Finally, it is suggested that the assessment of {PDO}-related regional climate impacts, reconstruction of {PDO}-related variability into the past with proxy records, and diagnosis of Pacific variability within coupled {GCMs} should all account for the effects of these different processes, which only partly represent the direct forcing of the atmosphere by North Pacific Ocean {SSTs}.},

	abstract = {River network connectivity ({RC}) describes the hydrologic exchange of water, nutrients, sediments, and pollutants between the river channel and other “sites” via heterogenous flowpaths along the river corridor. As water moves downstream it carries these constituents, creating a stream-to-ocean continuum of connectivity that regulates global water, carbon, and nutrient cycling. River network connectivity models have developed over many decades, culminating in recent years with network-scale {RC} models that explicitly simulate the transport and exchange of water and elements from headwaters to coasts, sometimes requiring models to contain tens of millions of river reaches. These advances provide transformative insights into the aggregate effects of {RC} on water and material transport across scales from local to global. Yet, recent reviews have pointed to several challenges that need to be overcome to continue advancing network-scale {RC} modeling. In service of these goals, I summarize recent network-scale {RC} maps and models to identify similarities and differences across the large-scale {RC} modeling landscape. Although our computational and upscaling abilities have significantly improved and have revealed new insights, current models are still limited by the quantity, quality, resolution, and lack of standardization of the available in situ databases and source data maps necessary for the modeling. This suggests that we can extend recent advances if we keep improving these source datasets, while continuously revisiting our physics and theory to explain those new data. In doing so, we will continue to expand the role of network-scale {RC} models in informing water quality modeling and management into the future.},

It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate.

Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the Köppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic variables used in the Köppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension onto a 0.1\&deg;\&times;0.1\&deg; grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the Köppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most common climate type by land area is {BWh} (14.2\%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5\%, Tropical savannah).

In addition, an evaluation of a pair of {CESM}2 long preindustrial control and historical ensemble simulations is presented. These simulations were performed using the nominal 1° horizontal resolution configuration of the coupled model with both the “low-top” (40 km, with limited chemistry) and “high-top” (130 km, with comprehensive chemistry) versions of the atmospheric component. {CESM}2 contains many substantial science and infrastructure improvements and new capabilities since its previous major release, {CESM}1, resulting in improved historical simulations in comparison to {CESM}1 and available observations. These include major reductions in low-latitude precipitation and shortwave cloud forcing biases; better representation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation; better El Niño-Southern Oscillation-related teleconnections; and a global land carbon accumulation trend that agrees well with observationally based estimates. Most tropospheric and surface features of the low- and high-top simulations are very similar to each other, so these improvements are present in both configurations. {CESM}2 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.1–5.3 °C, larger than in {CESM}1, primarily due to a combination of relatively small changes to cloud microphysics and boundary layer parameters. In contrast, {CESM}2's transient climate response of 1.9–2.0 °C is comparable to that of {CESM}1. The model outputs from these and many other simulations are available to the research community, and they represent {CESM}2's contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6.},

Similarly, exponential growth in the development of different data analysis approaches has been reported in the literature, amongst which the K-means algorithm remains the most popular and straightforward clustering algorithm. The broad applicability of the algorithm in many clustering application areas can be attributed to its implementation simplicity and low computational complexity. However, the K-means algorithm has many challenges that negatively affect its clustering performance. In the algorithm’s initialization process, users must specify the number of clusters in a given dataset apriori while the initial cluster centers are randomly selected. Furthermore, the algorithm's performance is susceptible to the selection of this initial cluster and for large datasets, determining the optimal number of clusters to start with becomes complex and is a very challenging task. Moreover, the random selection of the initial cluster centers sometimes results in minimal local convergence due to its greedy nature. A further limitation is that certain data object features are used in determining their similarity by using the Euclidean distance metric as a similarity measure, but this limits the algorithm’s robustness in detecting other cluster shapes and poses a great challenge in detecting overlapping clusters. Many research efforts have been conducted and reported in literature with regard to improving the K-means algorithm’s performance and robustness. The current work presents an overview and taxonomy of the K-means clustering algorithm and its variants. The history of the K-means, current trends, open issues and challenges, and recommended future research perspectives are also discussed.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

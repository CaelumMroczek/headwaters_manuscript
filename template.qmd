abstract: |
  The abstract (1) states the nature of the investigation and (2) summarizes the important conclusions. The abstract should be suitable for indexing. Your abstract should:

    - Be set as a single paragraph.
    - Be less than 250 words for all journals except GRL, for which the limit is 150 words.
    - Not include table or figure mentions.
    - Avoid reference citations unless dependent on or directly related to another paper (e.g., companion, comment, reply, or commentary on another paper(s)). AGU’s Style Guide discusses formatting citations in abstracts.
    - Define all abbreviations.

plain-language-summary: |
  A Plain Language Summary (PLS) can be an incredibly effective science communication tool. By summarizing your paper in non-technical terms, you can explain your research and its relevance to a much broader audience. A PLS is required for submissions to AGU Advances, G-Cubed, GeoHealth, GRL, JAMES, JGR: Biogeosciences, JGR: Oceans, JGR: Planets, JGR: Solid Earth, JGR: Atmospheres, Space Weather, and Reviews of Geophysics, but optional for other journals.  A PLS should be no longer than 200 words and should be free of jargon, acronyms, equations, and any technical information that would be unknown to people from outside your scientific discipline. Read our tips for creating an effective PLS.

key-points:
  - Key Points convey the main points and conclusions of the article. 
  - Up to three key point statements are allowed, and each is limited to at most 140 characters with no abbreviations.

## Introduction

### Headwaters (importance to greater systems, regions of groundwater-surface water interaction)

### Arid landscapes (climate effects, under studied)

### Baseflow

## Data & Methods

### Data

#### Study Area

-   USGS streamgages from the historical study period of 1950 – 2024 were filtered to include sites with \>90% data completeness. Any sites with data gaps \>3 continuous years were removed.

-   Only sites with catchments fully within the borders of the US were used, due to data restrictions

#### Headwater delineation

-   Headwaters defined as Strahler Stream Order 1 + 2 (as found in multiple papers)

-   To study headwater systems, we only used streamgages that fit our previous filters and were located on a stream order 1-3 stream

    -   This allows us to analyze the *headwater systems*

#### Climate Data

-   [Livneh](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.livneh.html) for historical

    -    monthly minimum and maximum temperature, and monthly mean precipitation

        -   Can use to calculate \~ mean temp (max-min)

-   LOCA version 2 for climate projections

    -   monthly minimum and maximum temperature, and monthly mean precipitation

        -   provided in the original dataset

        -   1950-2100

    -   [SSP](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1443/2019/gmd-12-1443-2019.html) 245 & SSP 585

        -   Represents the 'best-case' and 'worst-case' scenarios

### Base-flow Separation

### Trend & Correlation Analyses

## Results

### Historical Base-flow Analysis

#### Spatial Variability of Baseflow (PCA/Classifications)

#### Temporal Variability of Baseflow

##### Monthly
